Well, after posting the rant, I received a friendly PM from [fishboy1](http://www.reddit.com/user/fishboy1) requesting my address so he could send me a bottle of Vegemite.  What did I have to lose?  It wasn't costing me any money and even though I doubted the results would be much different, it wasn't going to kill me.  

Five days later and a box arrives in the mail.  Under massive amounts of packing peanuts, wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap I find a bottle of Vegemite, complete with the Australian nutrition facts (these were interesting to me, for some reason).

Luckily, I had some good, fresh bread yesterday that I could toast.  Everybody was telling me that it was the best way to consume the yeast product.  Toasted and liberally buttered, I spread a thin layer of Vegemite on the bread.  First off, I noticed the texture was completely different than that of Marmite.  The Marmite was goopy and looked like used motor oil or chain grease.  Vegemite had more of a solid fat consistency, like that of lard, which made it much easier to spread.  Also, the smell of the Vegemite wasn't nearly as rank.

I tried a bite, preparing myself for the potential gag reflex...

It never came.  Unlike my experience with Marmite, this stuff was quite palatable.  I won't lie, I'm still not really a fan of the stuff.  It's just a tad too bitter for my tastes.  But, I can definitely see how some people can enjoy it.  

Well, I ended up finishing the slice of toast.  I think I may keep this bottle around and try some of the stuff that was suggested to me in my previous post.  Maybe add it to a beef stock, or just eat it on toast again purely for the nutritional benefits.  Who knows, maybe it will grow on me.  

BTW, does this stuff require refrigeration after opening?  I couldn't find anything on the bottle about it, so I decided to, just in case.

yeast extract,kx9s7jj,comment,">The loophole, as it were, is that for nonorganic foods, the regulations do not restrict the dozens of other ingredients like preservatives and solvents that can go into a so-called natural flavor. Ultimately, because of the wide variety of ingredients that typically go into “natural” flavorings, “there does not seem to be much of a difference between natural and artificial flavors,” said David Andrews, a scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization.

>While food processors must list all of the ingredients on a food label, flavor manufacturers do not have to disclose their ingredients. They can add synthetic solvents, preservatives, emulsifiers, carriers and other additives to a flavor that qualifies as natural under current regulations. Natural flavors allowed for use in certified organic foods are subject to a different, far more restrictive set of regulations. They cannot contain a long list of ingredients, including synthetic solvents, carriers and emulsifiers or artificial preservatives, said Gwendolyn Wyard, the Organic Trade Association’s vice president of regulatory and technical affairs. They must use non-petroleum-based solvents, cannot be irradiated and cannot use flavor extracts derived from genetically engineered crops.

Natural flavors offer an extensive loophole for food manufacturers to dump ingredients that consumers likely would be concerned about.

yeast extract,kk63z2f,comment,"A typical serving of chips isn’t fentanyl; it’s not going to kill you, nor will it significantly derail your health and fitness goals so long as your diet is otherwise good. They don’t provide much nutrition but you shouldn’t be relying on chips to get nutrients anyway. They’re a snack that you can enjoy as part of an otherwise healthy diet. 

That being said, aside from the unusual number of calories (I’ve usually seem 160-300 calories per serving but that’s just my experience) there isn’t anything obviously immediately dangerous and a higher than usual amount of protein (from the lentils and peas I guess). 

I wouldn’t allocate a quarter of my daily calories to chips but once in a while? You could do a lot worse than what you described.

yeast extract,kk6llpm,comment,"It’s not just about the ingredients. Chips are very high in calories. As a side note, many ingredients that people online might tell you to freak out about are either completely harmless and they’ve just chosen a complex sounding word to fear monger about or they are only harmful in very very high quantities that the average person would never consume. 

Back to the chips, you’d be shocked at how small a portion size that 450 calories is. Not only that, you will be hungry again very quickly, meaning you’ll go back to the kitchen and consume even more calories. Potato chips have a high addiction factor and very low satiety factor. 

Nothing wrong with chips on occasion, but they should not be your go to snack or you will find yourself gaining weight pretty quickly. Things like fruit and nuts will keep you full longer and add more nutrition to your diet at a fraction of the calories.  

 Now nuts are also high in calories but they are pretty satisfying, so you don’t need to eat that many. ",ingredient chip high calorie note ingredient people online tell freak completely harmless choose complex sound word fear monger harmful high quantity average person consume chip shock small portion size 450 calorie hungry quickly mean kitchen consume calorie potato chip high addiction factor low satiety factor wrong chip occasion snack find gain weight pretty quickly thing like fruit nut long add nutrition diet fraction calorie nut high calorie pretty satisfying need eat,0.067,0.816,0.116,0.9132,4

yeast extract,k415h9a,comment,"#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

No one reads past the first few comments, so I'll be real with you. You started this whole thing off by being a bit ""extra"" and trying to put me in my place in regards to my understanding about cajun food, and there's a decent chance you really do know more about it than I do. BUT, OP asked a legitimate question about carcinogens in food and I tried to give my best answer based on my understanding,

 I'm not a dietician, not a nutritionist, not even a chef who specializes in ""healthy"" food, quite the opposite in fact, but I took one college level nutrition course in culinary school, for what it's worth.
 

This is a nutrition sub, not a food historian debate sub. MY UNDERSTANDING(flawed as it may be) is that if a food item has been cooked until it appears black, then that food item now has more carcinogens than it had previously. Smoking(aka what the South might call barbecue) is inherently carcinogenic, so is grilling(what us up in Canada call barbecue). And if one were to take a bunch of butter and finely ground spices and put them in a pan and cooked them until they were black, well, based on my understanding, that would also be carcinogenic.


Now, if you want to dispute those statements with some valid research, then I pride myself as someone who is willing to have their mind changed. But so far, all that you have brought to this conversation seems to be some sort of semantic disagreement about what the word ""char"" means, and I know JUST enough about (american)southern food culture to give you some grace in your definitions, although I did have my own fun at your expense lol.


At the end of the day, OP asked for advice about avoiding carcinogens, IDK and IDC why they are avoiding them, but I gave them the best answer that I had to give them.

I prefer dark, thick beers with a yeasty flavor and feel that too many hops can take away from the flavor, rather than add to it (IPAs are horrid, IMO).  This is probably why I prefer the milder flavor of Vegemite to that of Marmite.  It's the extreme bitterness that gets to me, not the flavor.  Alternatively, I would love to try Gentleman's Relish.  I'm a fan of anchovies and fail to see the comparison between it and yeast extracts.  Does the Relish have a somewhat bitter taste as well?  Or, is it just salty/peppery like a regular anchovy?

Growing barley isn't out of the ordinary around here.  You can't drive for more than 10km without seeing a field or two.  We're just blessed with the perfect environment for it, I guess.  But, we don't see many hop vines around here unless it's for personal use (home brewing and micro-breweries are very popular in my area).  They just don't seem to like the cold winters we have.

[According to this site](https://foodrevolution.org/blog/natural-flavors/), ""natural flavors"" can vary by country:

> * **US:** natural flavors can be an essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis (... means fermentation caused by an enzyme).
> * **India:** requires that they’re derived exclusively from vegetables and doesn’t allow microbiological processes.
> * **Japan:** natural flavors can be made from a limited list of plant and animal sources.
> * **Canada:** any flavorings that are not made from plant, animal, or microbiological sources have to be called “artificial flavorings.”

Been working on my ramen making for a while now. Have to say finally happy with the results. Big shout out to u/ramen_lord and way of ramen for their knowledge base. 

Anyways on to the good stuff. Here we got a Tori Shoyu ramen.

Aroma oil is chiyu infused with garlic, onion, and sakura ebi. 

The tare is a blend of koikuchi, and usukuchi shoyu, niboshi/sababushi dashi, salt, sake, mirin, fish sauce, msg, splash of rice vinegar, aromatics (green onion, garlic, yuzu peel, and ginger).

Noodles are ~34-35% hydration, made with KA bread flour, ramen supply type 1 kansui (100% sodium carbonate), and a bump of vital wheat gluten to take it from 12.7% protein up to 13.2%. Aged in the fridge for 24 hours. 

Stock is 2 pounds chicken backs, 1.5 pounds chicken feet, 1.5 pounds chicken wings. Pressure cooked on low pressure for 45 minutes. Then strained and transferred to a stock pot and finished with aromatics of just white onion, reduced to yield 3.5 quarts. (The real heavy lifting in flavor is done by the well seasoned tare and aroma oil). 

Toppings, equilibrium brined ajitama (u/ramen_lord ‘s recipe from his book), sous vide pork belly char sui, blanched Asian spinach (ohitashi) with some tsuyu and sprinkled on yuzu peel, green onion, and naruto fishcake. 

Equipment:

Instant pot Pressure cooker

Hozodo noodle maker attachment for kitchen aid stand mixer (I’ve also done this on an atlas 150 so the stand mixer isn’t necessary)

Joule Sousvide

Precision kitchen scale .01gr

I have ordered for joint-supporting my dog MSM from some particular brand, which says ""with OptiMSM"" (which is supposed to be third party tested for 99.99% purity). I read that the powder form of this substance has a very unpalatable taste, perhaps sulfury or eggy.

Thus, I've ordered both the powder and a capsule pack in case my dog wouldn't accept the powder.

He didn't seem to mind. I smelled the powder in its container and it smells very slightly like rubber or plastic of sort. I thought perhaps the flavor when dissolved in water would be different, but tasting a small amount gave a flavor the same as the aroma – slightly rubbery.

Does that sound right? Why would people claim they can only handle it in capsules, or after dissolving it in a lot of orange juice, but it doesn't seem like that with the type I bought?

polyphenols,1ew63wm,submission,"If anti-nutrients are of such concern, why not just consume more of the nutrients they inhibit? For example: phytate, oxalates and polyphenols bind to calcium, magnesium, iron, copper and zinc so they prevent them from being absorbed in the intestines, and glucosinolates prevent the uptake of iodine. Their effects don’t seem negligible because for instance, [the European Food Safety Authority recommends consuming more zinc in a high phytate diet](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3844).

But anti-nutrients only inhibit uptake of minerals to a certain extent, not completely. So doesn’t it just suffice to consume more of said minerals, like the EFSA recommends for zinc, as part of a healthy, balanced diet (and perhaps through supplementation)? We can also use preparation techniques like soaking, fermenting and sprouting that considerably reduce the amounts of anti-nutrients.

So unlike some proponents make it out to be, it really doesn’t seem to me like there is a case for cutting out grains (whether whole or not), legumes, vegetables and seeds out of our diets.

*""Blueberries and other foods topping the list were heavily promoted as disease fighters even if the science was weak.""*

>The USDA provided an ORAC database on its website highlighting foods with high ORAC scores, including cocoa, berries, spices, and legumes. Blueberries and other foods topping the list were heavily promoted as disease fighters even if the science was weak, from cancer to brain health to heart disease. However, 20 years later the USDA retracted the information and removed the database after determining that antioxidants have many functions, not all of which are related to free radical activity. [6] Despite the retraction, blueberry production in the U.S. doubled from 1998-2006, and has continued to increase every year through 2016 according to USDA data. [7]<

But they continue to fool people. Michael Greger is big on high-antioxidant foods and diets, but they might have little or no real benefit.

Iron

Zinc

Chromium

Manganese 

Once this occurs, your body no longer has access to these nutrients.
Generally, the more phytic acid you eat, the more minerals are blocked from your body.

However, recent studies have shown that phytic acid's anti-nutrient effect occurs only when large amounts of phytates are consumed within a diet that is already lacking nutrition. It also only affects the absorption of nutrients eaten at the same meal.

The anti-nutrient crowd is really about whole foods if you just listened to what they propose eating. They took their advice one step further because they realized that if all you do is consume a shitload of unprocessed food, you will hit other issues, like excess phytate or something.

Somewhere between people like them getting autistically concerned about anti-nutrients and people like you who are concerned with emphasizing the most basic of diet advice, you have the truth.

I see it like this:

The main ""anti-nutrients"" are the things which damage the inner body (which aren't necessarily observed as weight gain until after these organs have been damaged). These chief things are refined ingredients like sugar, flour, and oil. Sugar is a minor liver toxin, flour gets broken down into sugar too quickly, and polyunsaturated fats cause inflation, and inflation is the cousin of insulin resistance.

All of these things can be consumed in moderation, and there are superior variants of these things which limit the downsides. I think sourdough reduces some effects of flour. Fruit has sugar wrapped in fiber, so you won't have as many issues if you still consume it in moderation. For oil, just choose the oils that have good fat profiles (less of the inflammatory stuff).",mention bunch thing commonly consume form mean definition vegetable oil grain consume anti nutrient crowd food listen propose eat take advice step realize consume shitload unprocessed food hit issue like excess phytate people like get autistically concerned anti nutrient people like concerned emphasize basic diet advice truth like main anti nutrient thing damage inner body necessarily observe weight gain organ damage chief thing refined ingredient like sugar flour oil sugar minor liver toxin flour get break sugar quickly polyunsaturate fat cause inflation inflation cousin insulin resistance thing consume moderation superior variant thing limit downside think sourdough reduce effect flour fruit sugar wrap fiber will issue consume moderation oil choose oil good fat profile inflammatory stuff,0.025,0.88,0.096,0.946,-2

Pooled RRs comparing extreme categories of dietary LA intake (high vs low) were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.94; I2= 67.9%) for total mortality, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.92; I2= 3.7%) for CVD mortality, and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.93; I2= 0%) for cancer mortality. Pooled RRs for each SD increment in LA concentrations in adipose tissue/blood compartments were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.95; I2= 64.1%) for total mortality, 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.94; I2= 28.9%) for CVD mortality, and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.98; I2= 26.3%) for cancer mortality. Meta-regressions suggested baseline age and dietary assessment methods as potential sources of heterogeneity for the association between LA and total mortality.

However, most people couldn’t afford fancy fine bone china, and the cups available would crack from the heat of the boiling hot tea.

The solution? Pour milk into the cup first, then add the tea. The cold milk cooled down the tea enough to keep the china from breaking, and well, the reduced bitterness was just an added benefit!
