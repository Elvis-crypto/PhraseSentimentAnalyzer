Well, after posting the rant, I received a friendly PM from [fishboy1](http://www.reddit.com/user/fishboy1) requesting my address so he could send me a bottle of Vegemite.  What did I have to lose?  It wasn't costing me any money and even though I doubted the results would be much different, it wasn't going to kill me.  

Five days later and a box arrives in the mail.  Under massive amounts of packing peanuts, wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap I find a bottle of Vegemite, complete with the Australian nutrition facts (these were interesting to me, for some reason).

Luckily, I had some good, fresh bread yesterday that I could toast.  Everybody was telling me that it was the best way to consume the yeast product.  Toasted and liberally buttered, I spread a thin layer of Vegemite on the bread.  First off, I noticed the texture was completely different than that of Marmite.  The Marmite was goopy and looked like used motor oil or chain grease.  Vegemite had more of a solid fat consistency, like that of lard, which made it much easier to spread.  Also, the smell of the Vegemite wasn't nearly as rank.

I tried a bite, preparing myself for the potential gag reflex...

It never came.  Unlike my experience with Marmite, this stuff was quite palatable.  I won't lie, I'm still not really a fan of the stuff.  It's just a tad too bitter for my tastes.  But, I can definitely see how some people can enjoy it.  

Well, I ended up finishing the slice of toast.  I think I may keep this bottle around and try some of the stuff that was suggested to me in my previous post.  Maybe add it to a beef stock, or just eat it on toast again purely for the nutritional benefits.  Who knows, maybe it will grow on me.  

BTW, does this stuff require refrigeration after opening?  I couldn't find anything on the bottle about it, so I decided to, just in case.

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

yeast extract,kx9s7jj,comment,">The loophole, as it were, is that for nonorganic foods, the regulations do not restrict the dozens of other ingredients like preservatives and solvents that can go into a so-called natural flavor. Ultimately, because of the wide variety of ingredients that typically go into “natural” flavorings, “there does not seem to be much of a difference between natural and artificial flavors,” said David Andrews, a scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization.

>While food processors must list all of the ingredients on a food label, flavor manufacturers do not have to disclose their ingredients. They can add synthetic solvents, preservatives, emulsifiers, carriers and other additives to a flavor that qualifies as natural under current regulations. Natural flavors allowed for use in certified organic foods are subject to a different, far more restrictive set of regulations. They cannot contain a long list of ingredients, including synthetic solvents, carriers and emulsifiers or artificial preservatives, said Gwendolyn Wyard, the Organic Trade Association’s vice president of regulatory and technical affairs. They must use non-petroleum-based solvents, cannot be irradiated and cannot use flavor extracts derived from genetically engineered crops.

They don’t provide much nutrition but you shouldn’t be relying on chips to get nutrients anyway. They’re a snack that you can enjoy as part of an otherwise healthy diet. 

That being said, aside from the unusual number of calories (I’ve usually seem 160-300 calories per serving but that’s just my experience) there isn’t anything obviously immediately dangerous and a higher than usual amount of protein (from the lentils and peas I guess). 

I wouldn’t allocate a quarter of my daily calories to chips but once in a while? You could do a lot worse than what you described.

Back to the chips, you’d be shocked at how small a portion size that 450 calories is. Not only that, you will be hungry again very quickly, meaning you’ll go back to the kitchen and consume even more calories. Potato chips have a high addiction factor and very low satiety factor. 

Nothing wrong with chips on occasion, but they should not be your go to snack or you will find yourself gaining weight pretty quickly. Things like fruit and nuts will keep you full longer and add more nutrition to your diet at a fraction of the calories.

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

No one reads past the first few comments, so I'll be real with you. You started this whole thing off by being a bit ""extra"" and trying to put me in my place in regards to my understanding about cajun food, and there's a decent chance you really do know more about it than I do. BUT, OP asked a legitimate question about carcinogens in food and I tried to give my best answer based on my understanding,

 I'm not a dietician, not a nutritionist, not even a chef who specializes in ""healthy"" food, quite the opposite in fact, but I took one college level nutrition course in culinary school, for what it's worth.
 

This is a nutrition sub, not a food historian debate sub. MY UNDERSTANDING(flawed as it may be) is that if a food item has been cooked until it appears black, then that food item now has more carcinogens than it had previously. Smoking(aka what the South might call barbecue) is inherently carcinogenic, so is grilling(what us up in Canada call barbecue). And if one were to take a bunch of butter and finely ground spices and put them in a pan and cooked them until they were black, well, based on my understanding, that would also be carcinogenic.


Now, if you want to dispute those statements with some valid research, then I pride myself as someone who is willing to have their mind changed. But so far, all that you have brought to this conversation seems to be some sort of semantic disagreement about what the word ""char"" means, and I know JUST enough about (american)southern food culture to give you some grace in your definitions, although I did have my own fun at your expense lol.

I recently tried Roar Organic’s Cucumber Watermelon drink which I find tastes great, has a variety of vitamins/electrolytes and only contains 2 grams of sugar. I was doing some research and found that Roar went through an entire rebrand, and per an article in ADWEEK, “This Beverage Brand's Aesthetic Is, Proudly, 'Yoga Pants on a Bottle.’ Roar Organic changed its entire brand, from the formula to its social handle.”

What I don’t understand is they claim a total of 2g of sugar (1 added) per bottle (18oz) but yet the second ingredient is organic coconut water from concentrate and the forth ingredient organic cane sugar. 

“INGREDIENTS:
FILTERED WATER, ORGANIC COCONUT WATER FROM CONCENTRATE (WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE, ORGANIC COCONUT WATER CONCENTRATE), ORGANIC ERYTHRITOL, ORGANIC CANE SUGAR, ORGANIC NATURAL FLAVORS, OR - GANIC FRUIT & VEGETABLE JUICE FOR COLOR, SEA SALT, L-MALIC ACID, ASCOR-BIC ACID (VITAMIN C), POTASSIUM CI-TRATE, CITRIC ACID, ORGANIC STEVIA LEAF EXTRACT, D-CALCIUM PANTOTHEN - ATE (VITAMIN B-5), D-ALPHA-TOCOPHER-YL ACETATE (VITAMIN E). RETINYL PALMITATE (VITAMIN AJ. PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN B-6), CYANOCOBALA-MIN (VITAMIN B-12).”

I wasn’t able to find specific sugar details for coconut concentrate however pure coconut water contains between 10-13 grams per serving (Ex: Trader Joe’s Single Origin Organic Coconut Water has 11g sugar) and organic cane sugar is 4g of sugar per 1 tsp. 

My question is, if coconut water has sugar and they are adding sugar cane, how is it possible that a 18oz drink only has only 2 grams of total sugar with 1g added? Is it such that coconut concentrate has 0g of sugar and they are putting a very very small amount of sugar cane?

I'll be honest, it can be quite challenging to get myself to drink water. I still drink it, especially when I work out but for daily consumption I notice that I can go a day or two without drinking any but when I started drinking Sparkling water from the Clear american brand, it's something I do tend to drink a little more of but I was just curious if it was really a healthy alternative.

I have whey protein isolate stocked to provide a stable protein source and some micronutrients if meat ever becomes difficult to obtain in the near future. The nutrition label is pretty lacking in information and another source I’ve used doesn’t exactly agree with the product I’m using even though I was under the impression that there aren’t too many ways to make a different whey protein isolate other than fortifying it.

The total carbohydrate, protein, calcium, and potassium content are very different.

If I have a bar, however, I can eat that whenever I want.

I surely won't be getting the micronutrients I need through these protein bars alone.  It's not all I'm eating, but it's kindof replaced lunch.

I looked at the ingredients in the bar, and they don't seem bad : *Protein blend (whey protein isolate and milk protein isolate), dietary fiber from tapioca starch, cashews, unsweetened chocolate, erythritol, natural flavor, water, cocoa butter, sea salt, sunflower lecithin, steviol, glycosides (stevia).*

The erythritol and stevia are the only tangentially concerning ingredients in here.

Cream, sugar, vanilla extract. Nice and easy, terribly fatty, tastes amazing, no filler. 

Then I realized I was using the ""imitation vanilla extract"" I've had for whenever I bake something. I purchased some all natural stuff for my next batch. To me, it tasted terrible compared to the imitation stuff. I figured I got a bad bottle or brand, so I decided to try a completely different brand. The flavor was exactly the same. Now, the ice cream with the natural flavor isn't bad compared to a lot of the store bought stuff, but if I'm honest with myself I significantly prefer the imitation flavor.

natural flavoring,4fz9lq,submission,"Help/Advice Request: Disgusting Black-Eyed Peas Hello all,

I've been drooling over this forum on a daily basis for a few months now but this is my first time posting here. I have a somewhat strange help/advice request.

I am normally a pretty good cook and certainly find myself completely satisfied with my own cooking, however I attempted to make a pot of black-eyed peas a couple days ago and it *did not* go well.

I got a bag of dried black-eyed peas from the store (generic brand) and followed the instructions exactly, which were:

1. Quick soak option: Peas in water. Rapid boil. Remove. Let sit 1 hour. Drain and rinse.
2. Re-fill with water. Medium-high heat. Reduce to low. Simmer gently with tilted lid for 1.5 hours or until desired tenderness.

So, I did all that, and at the end, I was left with black-eyed peas that basically tasted like dirt. So, unpleasant. I've had black-eyed peas before, and enjoyed them, so I figured maybe the dirt flavor is their natural flavor and I just need to add seasoning/sauce each time I eat them.

The first time I eat them, I seasoned them, couldn't cover up the gross taste. I had already made the food, so I ate it anyway. No real problem other than my brain repeatedly telling me not to keep eating it, which I ignored.

I just ate another serving of them last night, and this time things did not go as well. Let's just say the peas went through my body within less than 15 minutes, and caused a great deal of stomach/intestine/colon pain. Also, they tasted equally bad if not slightly worse.

The effects of eating them the second time were very close to one time in college when I was poor and, out of cheapness, ate a bowl of black beans I had accidentally left out over night. Except, that experience was about 30% worse than the experience yesterday.

So, I feel like the peas somehow got rancid but I just can't figure out how. They went straight from the cooking pot into a big Tupperware and into the refrigerator. Not to mention, they tasted awful straight out of the pot.

So, what the heck did I do wrong here?!?! Is it possible the dried peas were somehow bad from the start? They looked perfectly fine to me, although I don't have a huge amount of experience with cooking beans/legumes/etc. I'm totally at a loss here and hoping someone on this sub might have some idea or suggestion as to what went wrong. I'd post a pic of the peas, but the just look like all the other black-eyed peas I've ever seen.

**Total Carbohydrate** 1g (0%)

Sugars 0g

**Erythritol** 1g - Erythritol ((2R,3S)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol) is a sugar alcohol (or polyol) that has been approved for use as a food additive in the United States and throughout much of the world. In general, erythritol is free of side effects in regular use. Doses over 50 grams (1.8 oz) can cause a significant increase in nausea and stomach rumbling (borborygmi). Rarely, erythritol can cause allergic hives (urticaria).

When compared with other sugar alcohols, it is also much more difficult for intestinal bacteria to digest, so is less likely to cause gas or bloating than other polyols, such as maltitol, sorbitol, or lactitol.

**Protein** 0g

___

**Niacin** 100% - Niacin (also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid) is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NO2 and, depending on the definition used, one of the 20 to 80 essential human nutrients.

Not enough niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. Chronic Niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra. 

However, too much is also bad. Pharmacological doses of niacin (1.5 - 6 g per day) lead to side effects that can include dermatological conditions such as skin flushing and itching, dry skin, and skin rashes including eczema exacerbation and acanthosis nigricans. 

**Vitamin B6** 100% - The primary role of vitamin B6 is to act as a coenzyme to many other enzymes in the body that are involved predominantly in metabolism. 

There were lots of fancy words here I didnt get, but I get the feeling its to help you metabolize sugar and to give your body quicker, more immediate access to the energy in the drink.

**Vitamin B12** 100% - Vitamin B12, vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid synthesis (especially odd chain fatty acids) and energy production.

The dietary reference intake for an adult ranges from 2 to 3 µg per day (USA), and 1.5 µg per day (UK). 1 µg = 1e-6g. Seriously, you need very little...

However, Vitamin B12 deficiency can potentially cause severe and irreversible damage, especially to the brain and nervous system. At levels only slightly lower than normal, a range of symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and poor memory may be experienced.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis.

**Pantothenic Acid** 100% - Also called pantothenate or vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a water-soluble vitamin. For many animals, pantothenic acid is an essential nutrient. Animals require pantothenic acid to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), as well as to synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. This metabolic function is probably why its in the drink.

A normal adult male/female (14yo+) needs 5mg/day. 

Deficiency of this acid is so rare that it has not been thoroughly studied. Toxicity of pantothenic acid is unlikely. In fact, no Tolerable Upper Level Intake (UL) has been established for the vitamin. Large doses of the vitamin, when ingested, have no reported side effects and massive doses (e.g., 10 g/day) may only yield mild intestinal distress, and diarrhea at worst. It has been suggested, however, that high doses of pantothenic acid might worsen panic attacks in those with panic disorder by prolonging the duration until adrenal exhaustion.

Ingredients:

**Carbonated Water** - Unflavoured carbonated water erodes tooth enamel, though the effect is negligible.

Intake of carbonated beverages has not been associated with increased bone fracture risk in observational studies, and the net effect of carbonated beverage constituents on the amount of calcium in the body is negligible. Carbonated water eases the symptoms of indigestion (dyspepsia) and constipation, according to a study in the European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

A 2004 article in the Journal of Nutrition found that fizzy waters with higher sodium levels reduced cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular problems in postmenopausal women.

**Citric Acid** - Seems like it's mostly for flavor, preservative, and it plays a role in the metabolism.

**Erythritol** - See above.

**Taurine** - Taurine is actually a naturally occurring organic acid and is widely distributed in animal tissue. It accounts for 0.1% of your total body weight. It is essential for cardiovascular function, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina and the central nervous system. Also serves a few other roles. For example, it acts as an antioxidant and has also been shown to help people with congestive heart failure by increasing the force and effectiveness of heart-muscle contractions.

Taurine is involved in a number of crucial physiological processes. However, the role of taurine in these processes is not clearly understood and the influence of high taurine doses on these processes is uncertain.It may also be necessary to take into consideration that absorption of taurine from beverages may be more rapid than from foods.

**Sodium Citrate** - Food additive. Sodium citrate is sometimes used as an acidity regulator in drinks.

**Benzoic Acid** (Preservative) - 

**Caffeine** - Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant. Consumption of 1000–1500 mg per day (a Rockstar contains 240mg per can) is associated with a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency with a wide range of unpleasant physical and mental conditions including nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and heart palpitations after caffeine use.

Caffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called caffeine intoxication (DSM-IV 305.90). This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500 mg at a time). 

The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.

In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.

Extreme overdose can result in death. The median lethal dose (LD50) given orally is 192 milligrams per kilogram in rats. The LD50 of caffeine in humans is dependent on individual sensitivity, but is estimated to be about 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body mass or roughly 80 to 100 cups of coffee for an average adult, or 300 cups of coffee for an adult living in the year 3000.

**Acesulfame Potassium** - Acesulfame potassium is a calorie-free sugar substitute (artificial sweetener), also known as Acesulfame K or Ace K (K being the symbol for potassium), and marketed under the trade names Sunett and Sweet One.

As with other artificial sweeteners, there is concern over the safety of acesulfame potassium. However, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved their general use. Critics say acesulfame potassium has not been studied adequately and may be carcinogenic, although these claims have been dismissed by the FDA  and by equivalent authorities in the European Union.

Research suggests that acesulfame K may affect prenatal development. One study appeared to show that acesulfame K is ingested by mice through their mother's amniotic fluid or breast milk, and that this influences the adult mouse's sweet preference.

Additional research on the effects of acesulfame K on mice revealed that chronic use over a period of 40 days resulted in a moderate but limited effect on neurometabolic function. These results suggest that chronic usage of acesulfame K may lead to impairment of cognitive function.

**Glucuronolactone** - Glucuronolactone is a naturally occurring chemical that is an important structural component of nearly all connective tissues. Glucuronolactone is rapidly absorbed and metabolized into non-toxic metabolites such as xylulose. In addition, humans may be able to use glucuronolactone as a precursor for ascorbic acid synthesis.

Glucuronolactone is a popular ingredient in energy drinks with claims that it detoxifies the body. Although levels of glucuronolactone in energy drinks can far exceed those found in the rest of the diet, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that exposure to glucuronolactone from regular consumption of energy drinks is not a safety concern. The no-observed-adverse-effect level of glucuronolactone is 1000 mg/kg/day. (Rockstar contains 100 mg per can.)

**Sucralose** - Sucralose is an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body, so it is noncaloric.

According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, the amount of sucralose that can be consumed over a person's lifetime without any adverse effects is 9 milligrams per day per kilogram of body weight.

**Sorbic Acid** (Preservative) - Sorbic acid, or 2,4-hexadienoic acid, is a natural organic compound used as a food preservative. The LD50 value of sorbic acid is estimated between 10-7.4 g/kg, which is quite high. The compound is relatively unstable and is rapidly degraded in soil, hence it is often considered environmentally friendly.

**Pantothenic Acid** - See above.

**Niacinamide** - Nicotinamide, also known as niacinamide and nicotinic amide, is the amide of nicotinic acid (vitamin B3 / niacin). Nicotinamide is a water-soluble vitamin and is part of the vitamin B group. Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin, is converted to nicotinamide in vivo, and, though the two are identical in their vitamin functions, nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological and toxic effects of niacin, which occur incidental to niacin's conversion. Thus nicotinamide does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing, although nicotinamide may be toxic to the liver at doses exceeding 3 g/day for adults.

**Inositol** - Inositol and some of its mono and polyphosphates function as the basis for a number of signaling and secondary messenger molecules. They are involved in a number of biological processes, including:

Insulin signal transduction, 

Cytoskeleton assembly, 

Nerve guidance (Epsin), 

Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration control, 

Cell membrane potential maintenance, 

Breakdown of fats and reducing blood cholesterol, 

Gene expression.

Some preliminary results of studies on high-dose inositol supplements show promising results for people suffering from problems such as bulimia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), agoraphobia, and unipolar and bipolar depression.

According to research, foods containing the highest concentrations of myo-inositol (including its compounds) include fruits, beans, grains and nuts.

**Natural Flavor** - Flavors naturally.

**Milk Thistle Extract** - Traditional milk thistle extract is made from the seeds, which contain approximately 4–6% silymarin. The extract consists of about 65–80% silymarin (a flavonolignan complex) and 20–35% fatty acids, including linoleic acid.

In herbalism, it is used in cases of liver diseases (cirrhosis, jaundice and hepatitis), gallbladder disease, and is claimed to protect the liver against poisons.

Research suggests that milk thistle extracts both prevent and repair damage to the liver from toluene and/or xylene. Workers who had been exposed to vapors from toluene and/or xylene for 5–20 years were given either a standardized milk thistle extract (80% silymarin) or placebo for 30 days. The workers taking the milk thistle extract showed significant improvement in liver function tests (ALT and AST) and platelet counts vs. the placebo group.

Beside benefits for liver disease, other unproven treatment claims include:

Lowering cholesterol levels

Reducing insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes who also have cirrhosis,

Reducing the growth of cancer cells in breast, cervical, and prostate cancers.

Clinical study has shown that liver function tests can be improved in active hepatitis patients.

Alzheimer's Disease prevention or treatment.


**Gum Arabic** - Gum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. 

Gum arabic's mixture of polysaccharides and glycoproteins gives it the properties of a glue and binder which is edible by humans. Other substances have replaced it in situations where their toxicity is not an issue, as the proportions of the various chemicals in gum arabic vary widely and make it unpredictable. Still, it remains an important ingredient in soft drink syrups, ""hard"" gummy candies such as gumdrops, marshmallows, M&M's chocolate candies, and edible glitter, a very popular, modern cake-decorating staple. Also called acacia after the original source, gum arabic is used as an emulsifier and a thickening agent in icing, fillings, chewing gum and other confectionery treats.

**Ester Gum** - Glycerol ester of wood rosin, also known as glyceryl abietate or ester gum, is an oil-soluble food additive (E number E445). The food-grade material is used in foods, beverages, and cosmetics to keep oils in suspension in water.

**Pyridoxine Hydrochloride** - Pyridoxine is one of the compounds that can be called vitamin B6, along with pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. 

Vitamin B6 assists in the balancing of sodium and potassium as well as promoting red blood cell production. It is linked to cardiovascular health by decreasing the formation of homocysteine. Pyridoxine may help balance hormonal changes in women and aid the immune system. Lack of pyridoxine may cause anemia, nerve damage, seizures, skin problems, and sores in the mouth.

**Panax Ginseng Root Extract** -  Folk medicine attributes various benefits to oral use of American ginseng and Asian ginseng (P. ginseng) roots, including roles as an aphrodisiac, stimulant, type II diabetes treatment, or cure for sexual dysfunction in men.

A common side effect of P. ginseng may be insomnia, but this effect is disputed. Other side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, headaches, nose bleeds, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, and breast pain. Ginseng may also lead to induction of mania in depressed patients who mix it with antidepressants.

**Guarana Seed Extract** - Guarana is a climbing plant in the maple family, Sapindaceae, native to the Amazon basin and especially common in Brazil.

In the United States, guarana has received the designation of ""generally recognized as safe"" by the American Food and Drug Administration.

Preliminary research has shown guarana may affect how quickly the body perceives itself to be full. One study showed an average 5.1 kg (11.2 lb) weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate, guarana, and damiana, compared to an average one-pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days. Although inconclusive about specific effects due only to guarana, this study differs from another showing no effect on body weight of a formula containing guarana.

Guarana extract reduced aggregation of rabbit platelets by up to 37 percent below control values and decreased platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid by 78 percent below control values. It is not known if such platelet action has any effect on the risk of heart attack or ischemic stroke.

**Caramel Color** - Caramel color or caramel coloring is a water soluble food coloring. Caramel color is a colloid. Though the primary function of caramel color is for coloration, it also serves additional functions. In soft drinks, it can function as an emulsifier to help inhibit the formation of certain types of ""floc"" and its light protective quality can aid in preventing oxidation of the flavoring components in bottled beverages.

California has listed a compound formed in the manufacture of Class III and IV caramel colors in the state's Proposition 65,[17] which requires the Governor to publish, at least annually, a list of chemicals ""known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.""

**Cyanocobalamin** - Cyanocobalamin is the most common and widely produced of the chemical compounds that have vitamin activity as vitamin B12. 

The oral use of cyanocobalamin may lead to several allergic reactions such as hives; difficult breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. Less-serious side effects may include headache, nausea, stomach upset, diarrhea, joint pain, itching, or rash.

Anyone else allergic to cinnamon (or another thing that doesn't have to be specifically listed on ingredients list?  
I have recently developed a full blown allergy to cinnamon after having a sensitivity to it since childhood. What makes this difficult is that cinnamon can be included in 'spices' or 'natural flavorings.' I have contacted several companies, and they have all refused to tell me if cinnamon is included in their product. They say they are protected by the FDA and don't have to divulge proprietary information. How do you avoid something that doesn't have to labeled? I contacted the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) and they told me they couldn't help me other than advising me to stay away from anything that has spices or natural flavorings on the ingredient list. Go to your pantry and look at 10 products. How many do NOT have one of those? Yeah. So I have a list of things I know it is in, based on my reactions to them. But I would like to talk with someone who either has this allergy or can offer any help. I also suspect I have celiac disease which further complicates things.

CORAL GABLES, FL--(Marketwire - Feb 15, 2012) - After less than two years of production, Turbana announced this week that its most recent endeavor, plantain chips, has surpassed its first major milestone -- 10 million servings. Turbana Plantain Chips hit the market in March 2010 as a natural alternative to traditional greasy potato chips. With this recent news, it is safe to say Turbana has successfully introduced a product that rates high in both flavor and consumer appeal.

Healthier alternatives for popular American snack foods continue to be in heavy demand. Turbana Plantain Chips are made with freshly harvested plantains, using only vegetable oil, salt and natural flavorings. By processing them in a state-of-the-art facility, Turbana ensures only minimal absorption of oil while leaving flavor uncompromised.

With 30 percent less fat than the leading potato chip brands, Turbana's Plantain Chips are free of trans fats, GMO, cholesterol, gluten, preservatives and additives. The chips also come in six delicious flavors, including chili, chili-lime, lime, sweet, lightly salted and garlic -- generating customer approval from even the pickiest of eaters.

""We are thrilled to have hit our 10 million servings milestone in such a short period of time. Our product sales have increased exponentially since we launched Turbana Plantain Chips in 2010,"" said Marion Tabard, marketing director of Turbana. ""We look forward to continuing to expand our fan base in the coming years by growing our distribution across the country as well as launching additional exotic fruit & vegetable snacks!""

Turbana has also seen an outpour of praise and interest on its social media sites. Facebook fans and Twitter followers alike have joined in sharing their Turbana Plantain Chip recipes and photos. Contests and giveaways on the two popular sites have likewise helped in maintaining online conversations and sales.

natural flavoring,ngjin,submission,"As promised, my review of the meal you guys voted on So you guys voted on my meal yesterday, and the winner was the [6 oz Tenderloin w/Port Wine sauce and 6oz Lobster tail](http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/393962_2859351564984_1295511116_33168558_2127267286_n.jpg)
It came with mixed veggies and chipotle mashed potatoes with bits of bell pepper inside.  I took the steak medium.




The first thing I dug into was the steak.  It was very tender, with just the right amount of juice left without it being too soft for my taste (the glory of a good medium).  The port sauce, which it was served in, was slightly sweet and tangy without giving it an overpowering flavor.  It was just enough to accent the beef and not drown it out.  The only real problem I had was that there wasn't more.  Honestly, next time I go, I may just end up getting a flat out steak if they're all this good.



Next up was the lobster.  Not being a huge lobster fan, I wasn't as impressed with it as I should have been considering how quality I knew it was.  It came with drawn butter and a very light herbal dust.  The texture of lobster (all shellfish, really) is really what kills it for me and, though delicious, I still had to kick myself into eating it.  The herbal crust was a bit much in my opinion, but it didn't draw away from the natural flavor of the lobster, and combined decently with the butter.



Next came the chipotle mashed potatoes.  These were actually rather surprisingly good, though the chipotle aspect was rather misleading.  They retained the slightly smokey hint to their flavor without being spicy.  Instead, combined with the bell pepper, they came out with a very bold flavor.  Although I love spicy food, this was a welcome diversion from the usual assumption that something chipotle has to be spicy.


The mixed veggies came last, usually being the least appealing thing to me on a plate (I usually prefer salads to cooked veggies as a source of greens).  These were alright, covered in a sort of very light vinegarette glaze that gave them a bit of an appeal.  Though I can't really say I would make them in my own kitchen, I certainly wouldn't mind eating them again if they came as a side.


That was it for the meal.  The Reata is a nice place, themed after a Western ranch while still retaining a sense of the class that Ft Worth has to offer anyone visiting.  The meal was preceded by a basket of miniature-cornbread muffins (delicious, by the way) and biscuits with acorns mixed into the batter (even more delicious).

But occasionally it is a great treat.  So I happened to pick up a pint of Ben N Jerry's Strawberry Cheesecake ice cream.  I always was under the impression that they made hippie ice cream that used natural flavors and what not.  Boy was I wrong.

About half way through, I made the mistake of looking at the label.  I can't find a copy of it online, but the only ingredient that sounded like it could possibly be in ice cream was skim milk.  That doesn't even totally make sense to me.  I assumed you would need whole milk.  The rest of the label was a bunch of soy, wheat, and corn products.  The funniest part was the fact that there wasn't even strawberries in Strawberry Cheesecake ice cream...  

This is just crazy.  You have a company that toots it's own horn about being natural and all that BS, yet it's no better than the regular stuff.  

The other funny one was how they listed that all of their milk comes from cows that have not been feed growth hormones, then directly under that, they say that they can not prove that all the cows have not been fed this hormone.

And a human RCT for that could be: just run a study with human subjects testing the effects on blood markers of consumption of packaged foods for 8-12 weeks. 

Or, you could apply a statistical adjustment on correlational studies between all cause mortality and consumption of said food accounting for other confounders such as physical activity, fruit/veggie consumption, BMI, negative lifestyle habits like smoking and drinking, etc.

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

The way it works is:  
(1) You enter your dietary preferences in natural language, e.g no artificial colors. no artificial sweeteners (but monk fruit, stevia are ok), no gums or preservatives.

natural flavoring,l4lxswg,comment,"Also, artificial doesn't mean unhealthy. And natural doesn't mean healthy.

Lots of natural sweeteners or ingredients like honey, lard/tallow, or sassafras are harmful when consumed in significant amounts. At the same time, there are lots of artificial ingredients that are very safe and healthy.

And in fact, the whole distinction of artificial, natural, organic, and similar terms are really just marketing terms designed to trick customers.

The phobia of processed or artificial ingredients in foods is ridiculous. You need to be judging foods on a case by case basis like looking at sodium, fat, and sugar content as well as looking at the ingredients, not by buzzwords.

As an example, let's look at the ingredients in Kraft Singles cheese slices and see if they are harmful. They are perhaps the most iconic example of processed food, with their vibrant yellow color and plastic-like soft consistency. They have a reputation of being terrible for you and contain a long list of scary sounding ingredients. And yet when you look at the ingredients, they are actually totally safe:

>Modified Milk Ingredients, Water, Cheese (milk, Modified Milk Ingredients, Salt, Bacterial Culture, Microbial Enzyme, Calcium Chloride, Lipase, Annatto*), Canola Oil, Corn Maltodextrin, Sodium Citrate, Salt, Sodium Phosphate, Lactic Acid, Cellulose Gum, Sorbic Acid, Carrageenan (carrageenan, Dextrose), Bacterial Culture, Annatto, Paprika Oleoresin, Calcium Chloride, Microbial Enzyme, Sodium Alginate*, Calcium Phosphate*, Citric Acid*. *may Be Omitted.

Modified milk ingredients are just things like whey, dried milk powder, and fermented milk products.

Water, cheese, and salt are all well known, I don't need to explain those.

The various bacterial cultures are safe of course.

Calcium chloride is just a calcium salt used as a thickener. It's actually generally good for you in moderation.

Lipase breaks down long fatty chains, which has the side effect of making it more digestible and breaking down unhealthy long chain fats.

Annatto, a red dye, and one of the few spices that actually deserve the reputation of a superfood. It's incredibly healthy stuff.

Canola oil. Not great for you, but also not bad in the tiny amounts you are eating as an ingredient in this cheese.

Corn maltodextrin. A safe thickener. It has a few carbs, but it isn't bad for you in the amounts they are adding.

Sodium citrate. Just the combination baking soda and citrus juice. It gives the cheese that soft texture and is quite safe.

Sodium phosphate. A thickener and preservative that also controls pH to make it last longer. It's quite safe. If you ate a huge amount (the equivalent of hundreds of cheese slices at once) it would at as a laxative, but hopefully you aren't eating that much anyways.

Lactic acid, an ingredient that comes from fermentation, it's safe. And it's a miracle ingredient, it was a huge part of the solution to the botulism deaths from preserved foods.

Cellulose gum, neither good nor bad for you. Your body simply doesn't process it.

Sorbic acid, one of the safest preservatives. It can he safely consumed in amounts similar to the safe intake of salt.

Carrageenan, a safe thickener made from seaweed. In a few people it can cause IBS, but for the vast majority of of the public it is safe.

Paprika, a dye from the spice. It is extremely delicious, healthy, and safe.

Sodium alginate, a safe ingredient made from seaweed. It's also the thing that makes the popping bubbles in those trendy bubble drinks.

Nothing on that list is something you should be worried about in the anounts they are using. The only thing that I'd be careful of is the slightly high salt content.",2,20,False,1716044832.0,VP007clips,0.9449971352083297,0.3333333333333333,0.3149990450694432,0.9983,0.31446354669282517,20.314463546692824,l4jo3qh

natural flavoring,l4lxuia,comment," was being a bit of a smartarse, but the protein I buy here in Australia may be something like what you're looking for, if I understand you correctly-

Uprotein Whey Protein Isolate, in Natural flavour.

INGREDIENTS: UPROTEIN Whey Isolate Premium + XHL Blend (99%) = [Instantised Whey Protein Isolate (Milk, Soy Lecithin), Whey Protein Hydrolysate (Milk), Added L-Leucine] + Proteolysis Digestive Enzymes (Papain, Bromelain).

Papain and Bromelain are simply fruit based enzymes (from Papaya and Pineapple, respectively).

That's it. That's all that's in it. No sweeteners or anticaking agents or Acesulfame K, or guar gum, or colours, or anything.


**Protein to Carb ratio** (reading off the back of my packet):

Serving size 40grams, 37.2g of which is Protein, and <0.1g is carbs. 

It has a *very* minimal amount of Soy Lecithin in it, which has not for the record triggered my soy sensitivity (which is typically to soy protein). Either way it has sweet fuck all in it.

Hopefully that's close enough for you??

It might already be available where you live?

natural flavoring,kwki4ve,comment,"TL/DR - I love energy drinks and they're my only remaining vice. So I treat them like one. 


I'm sitting here right now with my iced espresso. No milk or sugar. This is something I *really* enjoy. It's how I get my morning caffeine intake. 


However, I absolutely LOVE an ice cold standard red bull. Which just became available at certain convenience stores here in Vietnam a few months ago. I spend a few hours per day riding around in 37c/100f weather. So an ice cold red bull, one of the small ones, is absolutely orgasmic. I chug them in a few seconds.

If we advertised water like Red Bull advertises imagine that. But water doesn't cause negative/addictive side effects so there is no profit to be made.

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

natural flavoring,k9jsk87,comment,"I don't know too much about specific compounds used in monster, but I will say that the caffeine might not be good for you (depending on how much you drink).

If you are just drinking 1 serving (based on the 16 oz can), that is 160mg of caffeine daily. That amount (based on the research I've read) doesn't seem to have any known health effects.

Its also worth noting what other sources of caffeine you have throughout your day. Sodas, OTC medications (not all, but some), Chocolate, some snacks, etc all contain some level of caffeine.

For B Vitamins in particular, you would know whether you are overdosing on it long before you have long-term health issues. Overdosing on most vitamins can cause nausea, headaches, and other symptoms (which it takes a lot to start experiencing those symptoms). If you ignore those symptoms, then it could potentially cause nerve damage but you will experience the symptoms well before it does permanent damage

No one reads past the first few comments, so I'll be real with you. You started this whole thing off by being a bit ""extra"" and trying to put me in my place in regards to my understanding about cajun food, and there's a decent chance you really do know more about it than I do. BUT, OP asked a legitimate question about carcinogens in food and I tried to give my best answer based on my understanding,

 I'm not a dietician, not a nutritionist, not even a chef who specializes in ""healthy"" food, quite the opposite in fact, but I took one college level nutrition course in culinary school, for what it's worth.
 

This is a nutrition sub, not a food historian debate sub. MY UNDERSTANDING(flawed as it may be) is that if a food item has been cooked until it appears black, then that food item now has more carcinogens than it had previously. Smoking(aka what the South might call barbecue) is inherently carcinogenic, so is grilling(what us up in Canada call barbecue). And if one were to take a bunch of butter and finely ground spices and put them in a pan and cooked them until they were black, well, based on my understanding, that would also be carcinogenic.


Now, if you want to dispute those statements with some valid research, then I pride myself as someone who is willing to have their mind changed. But so far, all that you have brought to this conversation seems to be some sort of semantic disagreement about what the word ""char"" means, and I know JUST enough about (american)southern food culture to give you some grace in your definitions, although I did have my own fun at your expense lol.


At the end of the day, OP asked for advice about avoiding carcinogens, IDK and IDC why they are avoiding them, but I gave them the best answer that I had to give them.

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

 fruits or whatever. Artificial flavors are made in a lab. They're frequently chemically identical.

Where it gets funny is sometimes the sources of ""natural flavors"" are not the actual thing the flavor tastes like, like the above mentioned tree bark, or bug shells, or other random plant sources.

natural flavoring,jtgcxon,comment,"[fda.gov](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=501.22) defines the term. My takeaway is it can come from one of numerous places (so who the hell knows what it is in the products you're looking at!) and it must be for flavoring rather than nutrition.

>  The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors, include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants...

[According to this site](https://foodrevolution.org/blog/natural-flavors/), ""natural flavors"" can vary by country:

> * **EU:** the natural flavor has to originate from a vegetable, animal, or microbiological source and must be made through a traditional food preparation process.
> * **US:** natural flavors can be an essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis (... means fermentation caused by an enzyme).
> * **India:** requires that they’re derived exclusively from vegetables and doesn’t allow microbiological processes.
> * **Japan:** natural flavors can be made from a limited list of plant and animal sources.
> * **Canada:** any flavorings that are not made from plant, animal, or microbiological sources have to be called “artificial flavorings.”
> * **Australia/New Zealand:** In 2002, regulations in Australia and New Zealand were revised to remove any references to natural flavors, making it impossible to differentiate between artificial and natural flavors anymore.",1,13,True,1690328444.0,BrightWubs22,0.9977293046401096,0.5,0.4988646523200548,0.9551,0.4764656294308843,13.476465629430884,159gowx

I imagine a cleaner list of ingredients does not pose the same risk as synthetic nitrates/nitrites and added preservatives. Personally I avoid synthetic nitrates as they can be bad for asthmatics. 

https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190311-what-are-nitrates-in-food-side-effects

Jury is still out on whether natural nitrates from celery powder, cause any harm. This is because nitrates are readily available in other vegetables, particularly beets and are actually known to have health benefits. It is also known that naturally occurring nitrates don’t convert to harmful nitrosamines the way synthetic, chemical ones do. Nitrosamines are the actual cancer causing culprit here. 

https://www.verywellhealth.com/nitrites-vs-nitrates-5324098

For example, cured salami contains a lot of nutritional value but the sodium can be a bit much, and if you are watching sodium intake it would not be good for you for this reason. But it depends on whether it is naturally or artificially preserved if it is even worse for you. 

https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-salami-healthy#is-salami-healthy

And here is an article on uncured bacon. Often the way something is cooked contributes to more harmful nitrosamines forming as well. So again nitrates/nitrite in and of themselves aren’t the sole problem.

However that smoking increases your risk of CVD without a doubt (Proven) has been known and officially declared since 1964.

There is only a correlative risk factor with very high cholesterol and CVD. 
Saturated fat does raise cholesterol - cholesterol is responsible for many vital functions but one relevant to CVD is cell-membrane synthesis. The cholesterol is there to fix something- it’s not what actually does the damage, it’s there to fix damage.
Damage from inflammation (oxidative stress) to the endothelial layer (vascular cells) disrupts the endothelial barrier permeability and is causal in development of cardiovascular diseases. 
Inflammation lowers insulin sensitivity and constant elevated blood glucose can lead to chronic inflammation. Saturated fat is very stable to oxidation, however unsaturated fats oxidize very easily.
Any other oxidative or inflammatory factors contribute to further damage - the body cannot keep up with repairs from chronic inflammation and ends up forming plaque all over the place, once that plaque ruptures the vessel and clots enter circulation, it is the straw that broke the camels back and lead to a coronary event, but its not the cause for CVD, unless the cholesterol itself is heavily oxidized.

natural flavoring,j5c2goy,comment,"#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

natural flavoring,ira35bt,comment,"#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

Flavors have minimal if any nutritional impact on a product, and ONLY allow compounds that influence the sensory aspect of a product. Things like MSG cannot be included. It’s not used in the food industry to “hide” things, as if all of the flavor compounds that make up a cherry flavor were listed no one would buy the product as they wouldn’t understand what they’re reading.

natural flavoring,hvl2863,comment,"Both natural and artificial flavors are synthesized in laboratories, but artificial flavors come from petroleum and other inedible substances, while “natural flavor” can refer to anything that comes from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf—yes, we’re still going—meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or anything fermented from those foods, according to Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Deborah Kotz“

Natural and artificial flavors are the exact same molecules,” says Pia Sorensen, PhD, who teaches a course at Harvard on the intersection of chemistry and cooking. “Nutritionally, there is no difference between them. Usually, what’s nutritional in the food is not the flavor molecule.” The fact is, both natural and artificial flavors are often used to make processed foods enticing, even addictive.

If a company were to pay a premium for a natural vanilla flavor, they’re likely to just use a vanilla extract for the labeling benefits.

Fear of lawsuits completely exists - if the general belief is that big food is all about money, why would they not care about lawsuits that would almost guarantee a large settlement & having to change their practices anyways? It’s a simple cost benefit analysis. Not saying that it every company is the same, but it’s not as common as the internet makes it sound.

The EU has an upper limit of 0.1%. US & Canada do not. It’s used at ridiculously low levels, as it’s a strong flavoring ingredient. It’s also found naturally in “high” levels in things like mushrooms & tomatoes. Could some company use a high level of MSG, in theory? Sure, but no one would buy it as it would taste terrible. Back to it being about money.

There isn’t an regularly governed upper limit as 1.) no one uses a high amount anyways & 2.) theres a consensus, proven by multiple studies & across the world, by scientists, that outside of a hyper sensitivity in a relatively small amount and of people that can cause headaches, that MSG is completely safe.

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

natural flavoring,hst90vo,comment,"#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

Looking at recent events, the actor Bob Odenkirk recently suffered a heart attack. He will likely not die though, due to advancements in medical science. People can have stents and also take statins and pcsk9i to lower future risk, and a cardiac event provides motivation to pursue a healthier lifestyle.

I would say none of the fringe metas are taken seriously nowadays - you can look at the presidential advisory from the AHA on dietary fats or the position paper from the academy of nutrition and dietetics on dietary fats, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025, and you can see a consensus around limiting saturated fat intake.

The issue with the pufa criticism is that it fails to recognize that they generally come with powerful antioxidants. And that human beings also can make powerful antioxidants.

natural flavoring,fzjh9ze,comment,"Zolesse™ is a glycosylated stevia extract that I think is described in [US Patent application 2018 / 0116266 A1](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f4/2d/15/1c2046f8571557/US20180116266A1.pdf). The main difference to past stevia extracts is that they're doing controled lengthening or shortening of the glucose side chain with CGTase or amylase in order to have less of the rebaudioside A and rebaudioside B compounds that can give stevia extracts a bitter or metallic taste.

The [USDA definition of ""natural flavor""](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Flavors%20nonsynthetic%202%20TR.pdf) is “…the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolystate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or **enzymolysis**, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf of similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional.”

I expect the ""enzymolysis"" highlight above is how Zolesse™ gets to be called a ""natural flavor"". The ""clean label"" offered by a ""natural flavor"" designation is literally the main selling point for Zolesse™ in the [food processing press releases](https://www.snackandbakery.com/articles/93000-sweet-green-fields-and-tate-lyles-zolesse-natural-flavor). 

I am perplexed as to why other ""stevia extracts"" or ""steviol glycosides"" *don't*. I imagine it has to do with the fine points of the phrase ""essence or extractive"" above. They're **all** processed or fvcked with in some way, unless you're freshiy crushing monk fruit leaves, every commercial stevia product is highly refined.

natural flavoring,fs44085,comment,"The comments here have been very enlightening. I’m led to reconsider competing brands to get a purer product.

However, the micronutrient content of whey protein isolate remains elusive. No product is labeled with more than 7 of the common vitamins and minerals, though with the high micronutrient content of milk I’m expecting an appreciable amount to linger around in the whey protein isolate after the removal of ash, fat, and sugar. The vitamin B12 content is of particular interest to me as that is a difficult nutrient to come by in a plant-heavy diet.

[Dry, whole milk](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/dairy-and-egg-products/82/2) has the following per 100g:

* 6.1g ash
* 26.7g total fat
* 38.4g sugar (mostly lactose)
* **26.3g protein**
* **18%DV vitamin A**
* **19%DV vitamin B1**
* **71%DV vitamin B2**
* 3%DV vitamin B3
* **23%DV vitamin B5**
* **15%DV vitamin B6**
* 9%DV vitamin B9
* **54%DV vitamin B12**
* **78%DV vitamin D**
* 2%DV vitamin E
* 2%DV vitamin K
* **91%DV calcium**
* 3%DV iron
* **21%DV magnesium**
* **78%DV phosphorus**
* **38%DV potassium**
* **15%DV sodium**
* **22%DV zinc**
* 4%DV copper
* 2%DV manganese
* **23%DV selenium**

That the minerals calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium are significant in the whey protein isolate while fat-soluble vitamin D is consistently 0 across many different brands makes me believe that the process of purifying whey protein isolate typically removes all the fat-soluble vitamins but leaves much of the water-soluble vitamins and minerals in the final product.

So I *think* the end product should have significant quantities of B vitamins, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc, and selenium. Some proteins might even bind to some minerals, meaning that if the protein remains, so do the minerals.

EDIT 1: Yes! Some proteins *do* bind to the minerals!

>While the main mineral binders or chelators of calcium are the caseins, whey proteins bind specific minerals including calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, sodium and potassium

EDIT 2: Vitamin B12 is also available in whey protein isolate.

>Results indicate that WPI consumption improves active B12 and folate status. Unlike SPI, WPI consumption may prevent increase in MMA, HCY, and genome instability in older Australians with low vitamin B12 status.

Removing fat and lactose is literally the point of whey isolate. It’s to get the highest protein content out of whey possible. Whey and whey protein are 2 different things. Whey is actually something you can buy in some countries as a drink and doesn’t have a lot of protein. Only due to the further processing does it become whey protein powder.And whey is completely different to dried whole or whole milk for that matter. 

Can’t really speak on the other minerals and vitamins as I usually don’t pay attention to them. Lots of brands don’t even list them I think.

During my nutrition classes we had this subject and natural flavors is a pretty vague definition depending on your country's Food Administration.

So, for example, imagine you have a flavor extracted from a natural source to the point it's a 100% chemical compound, let's say Eugenol from clove for example, it will be labelled as natural flavor but the result would have been the same if you extracted it from an artificial chemical reaction",1,1,True,1589296570.0,whykar,0.034638815298439214,0.5,0.017319407649219607,0.6369,0.011030730731787968,1.011030730731788,gi3i9f

natural flavoring,eu7uege,comment,"It's the oxalate in tea. If eat you eat calcium with oxalate-rich foods you'll be fine. 

It's also sugar.

National Kidney Foundation:

https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidneystones_prevent

It's Not Just the Oxalate. Oxa-what? Oxalate is naturally found in many foods, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, grains, legumes, and even chocolate and tea. Some examples of foods that contain high levels of oxalate include: peanuts, rhubarb, spinach, beets, chocolate and sweet potatoes.

 Moderating intake of these foods may be beneficial for people who form calcium oxalate stones, the leading type of kidney stones. A common misconception is that cutting the oxalate-rich foods in your diet alone will reduce the likelihood of forming calcium oxalate kidney stones. 

While in theory this might be true, this approach isn't smart from an overall health perspective. Most kidney stones are formed when oxalate binds to calcium while urine is produced by the kidneys.

Instead: Eat and drink calcium and oxalate-rich foods together during a meal. In doing so, oxalate and calcium are more likely to bind to one another in the stomach and intestines before the kidneys begin processing, making it less likely that kidney stones will form.

Calcium is Not the Enemy. But it tends to get a bad rap! Most likely due to its name and composition, many are under the impression that calcium is the main culprit in calcium-oxalate stones.

 ""I still see patients who wonder why they are getting recurring stones despite cutting down on their calcium intake,"" said Dr. Jhagroo. ""I've even had patients say that their doctors told them to reduce their calcium intake."" A diet low in calcium actually increases one's risk of developing kidney stones.

Instead: Don't reduce the calcium. Work to cut back on the sodium in your diet and to pair calcium-rich foods with oxalate-rich foods.

Next time you drive past a lemonade (or limeade) stand, consider your kidneys. Chronic kidney stones are often treated with potassium citrate, but studies have shown that limeade, lemonade and other fruits and juices high in natural citrate offers the same stone-preventing benefits.

 Beware of the sugar, though, because it can increase kidney stone risk. Instead, buy sugar-free lemonade, or make your own by mixing lime or lemon juice with water and using a sugar substitute if needed.

 ""We believe that citrate in the urine may prevent the calcium from binding with other constituents that lead to stones,"" said Dr. Jhagroo. ""Also, some evidence suggests that citrate may prevent crystals that are already present from binding with each other, thus preventing them from getting bigger.""

So, Is Sparkling Water Affecting My Teeth?

According to available research, sparkling water is generally fine for your teeth—and here's why.

The result? The two forms of water were about the same in their effects on tooth enamel.

And in the sparkling water you have about the same ingredients. The only thing people would be worried about is the aspartame.

I have read the artificial sweeteners can inflate your blood sugar still, and can still contribute to the sugar addiction. While there is a lot of mixed information on this new studies show just regular sugar in small amounts is better than artificial.(I am not claiming this just something I read) 
We switched to non sweetened sparkling flavored waters, which are difficult at first, cause kicking the sugar/sweet taste  addiction is hard.  La-Croix is the best one i have  tried. Aldi also carried their own brand. Just the lemon or lime ones are very satisfying, well to me at least cause I very rarely have soda, I find it sickeningly sweet after not having it for a few weeks. 

This is also random but once I stopped drinking regular milk it was easier to stop soda. There is like 10-14g per 8oz of milk. No wonder we are addicted. 
The milk addiction was harder to kick than soda. Switching straight to almond/soy (unsweetened) is hard. It was easier after having  time off milk that I forgot what it tasted like that my taste buds accepted almond milk. If you have it side by side it’s pretty unsatisfying lol.

natural flavoring,e5hvp5y,comment,"for example:

a lime is crushed/blended/etc until it is a mush. it is then filtered. much like you did in organic chemistry 1, the remaining solution is then extracted with some kind of organic solvent (maybe even supercritical CO2) and then separated because the aqueous and organic layers are not miscible. finally, the organic solvent is removed via evaporation. you are left with the essence, or natural flavor, of limes. since sugar is water soluble, all of the sugar from the extract was removed earlier in the process resulting in a calorie free natural flavor. there are probably thousands of chemical compounds here that naturally occur in the lime.


this is as opposed to artificial flavors, which are a combination of synthetically made compounds that are either present in the highest concentrations in the essence of lime or the ones that have the greatest affect.

finally, the flavors may not taste or give the same mouthfeel of normal limes or lime juice because you are used to it being with all the water/sugar/electrolytes that are normally there in the actual fruit. since the market wants zero calorie and zero sugar drinks, this is what companies have decided to do.

But I get your problem. It's actually more a problem with the FDA labelling rules that allow castoreum to be listed as ""natural flavoring"". In other countries, like the UK, they'll list all the additives on the package. 

The problem for you is that the FDA says

> The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, and 182.50 and part 184 of this chapter, and the substances listed in 172.510 of this chapter. (From US FDA CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21)

Castoreum is in section [180.50](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0b94fe4d738a759ef1e4f2c25e1196e4&mc=true&node=se21.3.182_150&rgn=div8).

I don't really understand why the FDA chose to make ""natual flavoring"" such a broad category. I'm not American and don't have to deal with this. But frankly you guys need to update your labelling regulations.

natural flavoring,e007ynb,comment,"It depends a lot on how it’s labeled. For the most part, natural flavors are made up of the individual raw materials that make up the actual item in nature in varying amounts...eg a natural lime flavor might include lime oils and natural citral oil. Then that concentrated flavor goes into the final product at a very small amount. If the raw material isn’t from the named flavor itself (like let’s say the lime flavor also includes tangerine oil for some added depth of flavor perception) then label wise it really shouldn’t be allowed to say natural lime flavor alone but would have to say with other natural flavors. Flavor and extracts manufacturing association regulates a lot of flavor oriented things and it would be worth it if you’re interested to look into them. 


I mostly think natural flavors are totally fine and nothing to worry about. The only con I tend to see is that non natural materials can be used as the solvent in a flavor and still be called natural, like propylene glycol.

It seems like people like to mention castoreum because it's so strange and odd and unexpected and more than a little disgusting, so it may have become something like a horror story of food flavorings for some people. Even in the realm of perfume use, castoreum has a leathery scent and it must be aged for 2 or more years to allow the original harshness to fade and even start to become useful. That's more time and expense than it can take to get real vanilla.

Industry seems to agree https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castoreum#Food_use, only around 300 pounds of castoreum were used in 2005 but vanillin use was over 2.6 million pounds annually. I'd take ""artificial"" vanillin responsibly synthesized from plants or oils over an *all natural* flavoring actually made from dried beaver anal glands any day. 

Castoreum in food seems like a relic from when vanilla orchids weren't as well cultivated as they are now and frontier America and Canada were hunting a lot of beavers for their pelts with dried beaver glands being a side business. There was a lot of beaver hunting in the 1700s but vanillin was only first synthesized from cloves in 1874-75.

It is true that most of the fats we consume are triglycerides, but small quantities of mono and diglycerides can occur naturally in food. The processing of edible oils, for example, could make diglycerdes as a by-product.

As any unsaturated fatty acid COULD theoretically be in the cis or trans chemical form, whether the fat is a mono, di, or triglyceride does not really dictate whether the fatty acids attached on the glycerol are trans or not. 

Fortunately, as you could see on the ingredients list, the mono and diglycerides are used as emulsifiers. For this purpose, it is unlikely to occur in large amounts. I see that you're based in the US, which has mandatory trans fat labeling when it is above 1g/serve. You could always refer to this, but please do note that dairy fats do contain a small amount of naturally occurring trans fat that is unlikely to pose harm.

The cooked peas taste like that worm tasted. I know a worm isn't mildew, but mildew/mold/fungus/etc. is definitely a viable explanation now in my mind.

I did not do any sorting or sifting of the peas before cooking, which the instructions on the bag actually did tell me to do and I just ignored. The only thing I did in terms of cleansing was the dumping out of the first water from the quick soak, and then I did a second fill/dumping out, and then refilled the water a third time to do the actual cooking. So, it's entirely possible there was something nasty that made it into the batch. That actually could explain why the peas didn't make me sick the first time I ate them. Maybe I didn't get a large enough dose of whatever bad thing is in there the first time. Like I said before, they tasted a bit worse the second time I ate them.

I had purchased two bags of the black-eyed peas, so I've been toying with the idea of making the second bag and seeing how they turn out. Right now the thought of putting more black-eyed peas in my mouth is making me gag, though! I might have to give it a few days. Each bag was ~$1.70, so it's not worth taking back to get a refund.

Generally your body is really good at keeping control of its acid base balance (unless you have kidney disease or something) so you won't go into acidosis or anything dramatic like that, but this process does use up electrolytes to balance the pH and I think I remember it being specifically calcium. I know long term soda drinking is enough of an impact that it's correlated to lower bone density, just because it's so low ph, but if you're talking about replacing literally all your water with carbonated water I'd start to worry about the effects on your bones from the acidity even more than your teeth.

I don't know, but I doubt it.

What I do know is that the biggest problem with using orange flavored and scented substitutes in an orange drink is you don't get all the vitamins and minerals you need, but you get all of the negative things associated with lots of sugar.  In other words, oranges are good for you, orange drink is not.

Wild shrimp shell is organic.  However, from the labels I've seen the ingredient list is pretty short and usually you can pronounce them all.  If you can't pronounce it, you probably don't want to be eating it.

Almost universally, something that is less processed is better for you.  The sad thing is, it doesn't have to be so egregious, but that's what the quest for profit has brought us to.

People don't change things until they have to.  I had 12 chronic diseases at age 30.  I had to.  It was the chronic fatigue that finally made me go searching for answers.  Luckily, I'm stubborn and a bit naive, so I could thought I could fix the CF by avoiding blood sugar spikes rather than make another appointment to one of my many doctors and have them just scratch their heads and put me on prednisone.  No one understood it and I would tell my doctor I felt horrible, he'd scope me, and frustratedly tell me I SHOULD be fine.  All the while, I'm 5'10"" and 115 pounds.  I realized I had to fix myself.  Crazy thing was is that it worked, not to degree I wanted it to, but I felt so much better almost immediately.

natural flavoring,c55pgeh,comment,"""You'll find ""natural flavor"" or ""artificial flavor"" in just about every list of ingredients. The similarities between these two broad categories are far more significant than the differences. . . .Distinctions between artificial and natural flavors can be arbitrary and somewhat absurd, based more on how the flavor has been made than on what it actually contains.

""A natural flavor,"" says Terry Acree, a professor of food science at Cornell University, ""is a flavor that's been derived with an out-of-date technology."" Natural flavors and artificial flavors sometimes contain exactly the same chemicals, produced through different methods. Amyl acetate, for example, provides the dominant note of banana flavor. When it is distilled from bananas with a solvent, amyl acetate is a natural flavor. When it is produced by mixing vinegar with amyl alcohol and adding sulfuric acid as a catalyst, amyl acetate is an artificial flavor. Either way it smells and tastes the same. . . 

. . .A natural flavor is not necessarily more healthful or purer than an artificial one. When almond flavor -- benzaldehyde -- is derived from natural sources, such as peach and apricot pits, it contains traces of hydrogen cyanide, a deadly poison. Benzaldehyde derived by mixing oil of clove and amyl acetate does not contain any cyanide. Nevertheless, it is legally considered an artificial flavor and sells at a much lower price. Natural and artificial flavors are now manufactured at the same chemical plants, places that few people would associate with Mother Nature."" --[Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser](http://www.rense.com/general7/whyy.htm)

natural flavoring,c3kw358,comment,"There are several ingredients in this product that could be detrimental to one's health.

There are two sweeteners listed here, sucralose and acesulfame potassium. They work synergystically to create a taste 200 times sweeter than sugar, and a chemical compound that is extremely stable (enhancing shelf life). Both sweeteners are artificial, meaning ""cooked up in a lab"".

Both are a probable detriment to human health.

Sucralose is the primary ingredient in Splenda. From the book Sweet Deception ... ""sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that ""although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural.""
Also ""The presence of chlorine is thought to be the most dangerous component of sucralose. Chlorine is considered a carcinogen and has been used in poisonous gas, disinfectants, pesticides, and plastics. The digestion and absorption of sucralose is not clear due to a lack of long-term studies on humans. The majority of studies were done on animals for short lengths of time. The alleged symptoms associated with sucralose are gastrointestinal problems (bloating, gas, diarrhea, nausea), skin irritations (rash, hives, redness, itching, swelling), wheezing, cough, runny nose, chest pains, palpitations, anxiety, anger, moods swings, depression, and itchy eyes. The only way to be sure of the safety of sucralose is to have long-term studies on humans done.""

Link to study on dangers of sucralose : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?orig_db=PubMed&db=pubmed&cmd=Search&TransSchema=title&term=Journal%20of%20toxicology%20and%20environmental%20health.%20Part%20A%5BJour%5D%20AND%202008%5Bpdat%5D%20AND%20splenda


The second sweetener listed in acesulfame potassium, or acesulfame K. This sweetener is considered more of a health risk than sucralose.

Two links, one with general info, and the second, a human study of artificial sweeteners including acesulfame K.

The artificial sweeteners are not the only ingredients that are questionable. Blue 1, and Yellow 5, food colorants, are by-products of the petroleum industry, and are not considered to be safe to consume.

And finally, propylene glycol is an ingredient that maintains moisture content, and is used as an emulsifier. It is essentially a food/cosmetic grade mineral oil derived from petroleum. The chemical data sheet for bulk propylene glycol warns to avoid skin contact to prevent strong skin irritation. Propylene glycol can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.

Health, safety, and regulation

Sucralose has been accepted by several national and international food safety regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Joint Food and Agriculture Organization / World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives, the European Union's Scientific Committee on Food, Health Protection Branch of Health and Welfare Canada, and Food Standards Australia-New Zealand (FSANZ). Sucralose is one of two artificial sweeteners ranked as ""safe"" by the consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest. The other is neotame.[19][20][21] According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, the amount of sucralose that can be consumed on a daily basis over a person’s lifetime without any adverse effects is 9 mg/kg/day.[22][23]

""In determining the safety of sucralose, the FDA reviewed data from more than 110 studies in humans and animals. Many of the studies were designed to identify possible toxic effects, including carcinogenic, reproductive, and neurological effects. No such effects were found, and FDA's approval is based on the finding that sucralose is safe for human consumption."" For example, McNeil Nutritional LLC studies submitted as part of its U.S. FDA Food Additive Petition 7A3987 indicated that ""in the 2-year rodent bioassays...there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for either sucralose or its hydrolysis products...""[24]

Safety studies

Results from over 100 animal and clinical studies in the FDA approval process unanimously indicated a lack of risk associated with sucralose intake.[25][26][27][28] However, some adverse effects were seen at doses that significantly exceeded the estimated daily intake (EDI), which is 1.1 mg/kg/day.[29] When the EDI is compared to the intake at which adverse effects are seen, known as the highest no adverse effects limit (HNEL), at 1500 mg/kg/day,[29] there is a large margin of safety. The bulk of sucralose ingested is not absorbed by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is directly excreted in the feces, while 11-27% of it is absorbed.[4] The amount absorbed from the GI tract is largely removed from the blood stream by the kidneys and eliminated in the urine, with 20-30% of the absorbed sucralose being metabolized.[4]

First of all, calculate how much money you are spending per year on this junk. I'd wager close to $1000 per year. Not to mention the inconvenience of keeping your supply up, keeping it stored, and keeping it refrigerated. Over 10 years that's $10,000. You get the idea.

Been working on my ramen making for a while now. Have to say finally happy with the results. Big shout out to u/ramen_lord and way of ramen for their knowledge base. 

Anyways on to the good stuff. Here we got a Tori Shoyu ramen.

Aroma oil is chiyu infused with garlic, onion, and sakura ebi. 

The tare is a blend of koikuchi, and usukuchi shoyu, niboshi/sababushi dashi, salt, sake, mirin, fish sauce, msg, splash of rice vinegar, aromatics (green onion, garlic, yuzu peel, and ginger).

Noodles are ~34-35% hydration, made with KA bread flour, ramen supply type 1 kansui (100% sodium carbonate), and a bump of vital wheat gluten to take it from 12.7% protein up to 13.2%. Aged in the fridge for 24 hours. 

Stock is 2 pounds chicken backs, 1.5 pounds chicken feet, 1.5 pounds chicken wings. Pressure cooked on low pressure for 45 minutes. Then strained and transferred to a stock pot and finished with aromatics of just white onion, reduced to yield 3.5 quarts. (The real heavy lifting in flavor is done by the well seasoned tare and aroma oil). 

Toppings, equilibrium brined ajitama (u/ramen_lord ‘s recipe from his book), sous vide pork belly char sui, blanched Asian spinach (ohitashi) with some tsuyu and sprinkled on yuzu peel, green onion, and naruto fishcake. 

Equipment:

Instant pot Pressure cooker

Hozodo noodle maker attachment for kitchen aid stand mixer (I’ve also done this on an atlas 150 so the stand mixer isn’t necessary)

Joule Sousvide

Precision kitchen scale .01gr

Searzall blow torch attachment

I have ordered for joint-supporting my dog MSM from some particular brand, which says ""with OptiMSM"" (which is supposed to be third party tested for 99.99% purity). I read that the powder form of this substance has a very unpalatable taste, perhaps sulfury or eggy.

Thus, I've ordered both the powder and a capsule pack in case my dog wouldn't accept the powder.

He didn't seem to mind. I smelled the powder in its container and it smells very slightly like rubber or plastic of sort. I thought perhaps the flavor when dissolved in water would be different, but tasting a small amount gave a flavor the same as the aroma – slightly rubbery.

Does that sound right? Why would people claim they can only handle it in capsules, or after dissolving it in a lot of orange juice, but it doesn't seem like that with the type I bought?

First post here. Recently I had the best truffle pecorino of my life. In the picture.

I am curious to know if anyone shares my experience of truffles or feels in any way similar to me when eating truffles.

When I eat or smell truffle, or truffle oil, or really anything with truffle in it, I don't just taste or smell that lightly earthy, nutty mushroomy, taste/aroma, but I also experience a kind of light fluttering in my heart, a bliss, a warm glow which is more pronounced the stronger the truffle. 

Sometimes, with really potent, high quality truffle, this sensation is so strong that I could even liken it to the feeling of falling in love. It can be quite intense.

I really am talking about truffle, not any kind of illegal drug.

So I have been surprised to learn that no one else I have talked to feels this way about truffle. I had always expected that everyone did, and that is why truffles are so expensive, but apparently not! I read some time ago that truffle activates cannabinoid receptors or something similar and so this might explain it, but if so I am left wondering why I am the only one I know who experiences this sensation?

Is there anyone else out there that does feel this way? Or, if you like truffle, do you just like the flavour?",0,4,True,1672046606.0,Impossible-Secret-81,0.9936569405580985,1.0,0.9936569405580985,0.9854,0.9791495492259503,4.9791495492259505,
aroma,y1dy1k,submission,"[homemade] Lemon, garlic and rosemary roast chicken with beef dripping garlic and herb roast potatoes I often find roast chicken to be dry and boring compared to other meats, so this weekend I decided to put a little bit of extra effort into my first one ever, to see if I could make it delicious, and I was not disappointed.

I got this delicious free range, corn fed chicken, about 1.6kg, from my local farm shop and on Thursday night I stuffed it with 1/2 a lemon (cut into quarters), 1 whole bulb of garlic, with the top chopped off, and a few sprigs of rosemary. I also separated the skin from the breast a little to create a pocket which I then placed a few more sprigs of rosemary. I then rubbed the whole chicken with the head of garlic that I had chopped off, before disposing of it.

I placed the chicken in a tray, loosely covered with film, and left this in the fridge until Saturday morning when I removed the film and used paper towel to remove any excess moisture from the skin.

At around 13:00 I smothered the whole chicken with about 1/2 a block of butter (around 125g) and seasoned generously with coarse sea salt and black pepper and allowed to come to room temperature for approximately 1 hour.

I preheated the oven to 250 degrees Celsius (482 F) and once up to temp I placed the chicken on a rack in a roasting tray and put in the middle of the oven for around 45minutes. Once the skin was a delicious golden brown, I reduced the temperature to around 190 degrees Celsius (374 F) for another 15 minutes or so.

I then removed the chicken from the oven, loosely covered with tinfoil, and allowed to rest for approximately 30 minutes before carving.

The final result was a delicious, moist chicken with a wonderful golden, crispy, well seasoned skin, with delightful aromas of garlic and rosemary and a noticeable lemon taste. Delicious if I may say so myself.

For my birthday, I made an experiment in ice cream; I plucked several roses from my rosebushes, and made Rose Petal Icecream!

And the ice cream itself was delicious...after a few seconds. See, it had virtually no flavor when it first hit your tongue, almost like drinking skim milk. However, once you swallowed it, it released a fascinating flavor that was very distinctly the smell of fresh-cut roses onto the tongue!

This got me thinking; is there any food that I could combine this with to achieve a full flavor experience? What I need is a food that is the exact opposite; one that explodes instantly on the tongue, but then fades quickly, allowing the flowery aroma to waft across the palate after swallowing.

Stuff you literally can't get from the bag. (Plus it's healthier.) [Recipe Inside] So... if you are using a microwave, I won't call you wrong, but you are seriously missing out on fresh popcorn.

Ok, time for instructions.

Go to the store and in the snack isle they have a popcorn section. Pick up popcorn kernels by the bag. Nothing fancy, just need the unpopped corn variety. Don't even think about touching those fancy 'butter' infused oils. Just stop it. Just. The. Kernels. 

(Note the price on these badboys. They are cheap AF. This little half pound bag or whatever is going to make enough popcorn to fill your bathtub. If you're so inclined to do that. I'm not here to judge.)

Now for some oil. This is going to be the main flavor component of the popcorn. You can get a healthy variety of oil and it can still flavor really well; Olive oils, or any variety of vegetable oils will do the trick (Corn, Sunflower, etc.) And if you want the cream of the crop as far as healthy oils go? Avocado Oil. Might be harder to find though. Play around, I like peanut oil on my popcorn.

Get a large bowl receptacle. I have a wok, so I use that. But one of those [stainless steel](http://img5.foodservicewarehouse.com/Prd/500SQ/BrowneFoodservice_S781.jpg) curved  mixing bowls will work too. This will be used to cook AND eat it in!

Other ingredients you need; Salt, Alum.Foil, Blender.

Salt Prep: Take your regular salt (you heathen) and blend it up. Yes. Put that lame ass salt into a blender all by it's lonely self. Press the party (pulse) button and spin that bitch up like a DJ. Why? It's going to make the salt grain smaller, so they'll stick to the popcorn better. You are making muthafuckin'  popcorn salt. (For 1/2 cup of kernal, I might go for 1/4 to 1/2 a tablespoon.)

This recipe I'll give measurements for 1/2 cup of kernels. This makes a metric fuckton of popcorn. Don't underestimate the poppin' power of the pernicious napalm covered kernel.

I'd say a 1/2 cup would make the equivalent of 2-3 microwave bags. But this shit is healthy, so you can binge, it's ok.

So in the empty bowl, put in 2-3 tablespoons of your oil of choice. Heat this up until shimmering on medium heat. 

Get your kernels, salt, and  alum.foil ready. 

Put kernels in, and salt. Cover with Alum.foil (with several holes to leak any steam). As soon as you get yourself situated... get ready to start shakin'.

Within a minute or so, that party will start to get poppin'. DJ got a fresh mix goin', NICE.

Shake your bowl back and forwards, with the goal of getting kernels to sift to the bottom of the bowl to make their way back to the oil Jacuzzi. 

You'll have to be really vigilante to mix up the dance-floor (the f'in bowl, if you haven't caught onto the metaphor yet you dufus) towards the end of the pop. 

Once the popping get's infrequent, obviously it's time to pull it off. It's either have several or more kernels un-popped or have burnt popcorn. (No one likes burnt popcorn.) So play it safe.

And you're done. You can toss in and flavor with, whatever really. Butter if you must. But really, it's good. Whiff it in. That's a aroma you literally can't get from bagged popcorn. 

I have put cracked pepper and Parmesan cheese on my popcorn, it's a great success.

For a single dollar back in 1998, one could purchase an entire 7” supreme pizza. Half of this pizza had a nine-year-old me stuffed. It was a time some remember as the golden age of American dining, a renaissance of frozen cuisine.


Between then and now, the Party Pizza had become a staple of my diet. With time passed comes change, and change fell upon the Party Pizza. The amount of green peppers and onions steadily declined. Over the next couple years, the beef and pepperoni would become noticeably sparser.
To Totino’s defense, the Party Pizza in 1998 cost $1. I couldn’t expect the price to remain the same over a decade and half without cost cutting measures. The steady decline of quality was not just reasonable, but inevitable. Now an adult, I suppose my budget can afford a slightly higher end frozen pizza.


It did not take long for the allure of a one-dollar dinner to prove more powerful than my own self-discipline. Totino's had tempted me once again into a Walmart frozen food isle.

***

On an unassuming Monday night after a long day of work, I found myself too tired to prepare dinner. I popped a trusty Totino’s Party Pizza into the oven. In fifteen minutes I would feast upon a meal that the common man could be proud of.


The aroma of tomato sauce and browning dough wafted through my apartment. It must be ready. I opened the oven door to remove my masterpiece and noticed something slightly off. Some of the pie’s cheese was running off the crust and dripping onto the oven’s heat source. Abnormal, but I thought nothing of it. I cut and served the Party Pizza onto my finest china.


Two seconds into my first bite, something immediately tasted off. Instead of cheese, I tasted a hybrid of I-Can-Totally-Believe-It’s-Not-Cheese and canola oil. Has science come too far? This was no longer pizza, but a perverse baked nacho. Disgusted and shocked, I threw away my dinner.
The Totino's Party Pizza was no longer edible.


We all make mistakes, but some things are not to be forgiven. This was not a small misstep by an executive; this was a culinary crime against humanity. The greatest one-dollar frozen pizza of all time was now dead.

They are not only delicious, they are low in fat and calories, high in fiber and packed with antioxidants, which protect the human body from cellular damage caused by free radicals.


Strawberry Nutrients:

One cup of strawberries provides 50 calories and about 3 grams of fiber, most of which is soluble fiber. Studies have shown that fiber, particularly soluble fiber, can help lower LDL or “bad cholesterol”.


Fiber helps regulate digestion, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and possibly reduce risk of some cancers. Strawberries contain more vitamin C than other berries. Just one cup of strawberries provides 100% of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C for adults. Strawberries are also good sources of manganese, iodine, potassium, and folate.


Strawberries + Phytonutrients:

Strawberries are loaded with phytonutrients, plant chemicals that contain protective, disease-preventing, compounds, which have been shown to have health benefits. Phenolic compounds are complex organic molecules that a plant produces for protection against diseases and environmental elements. They are also responsible for a fruit’s color, flavor, and aroma.


Flavonoids are a type of phenol known to be potent antioxidants. They have also been shown in studies to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by inhibiting the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad cholesterol”, improving blood vessel function, and decreasing the tendency for blood clotting. In addition, studies have shown that flavonoids decrease the inflammatory process in the body, which helps protect the heart.

I should know better, I can't eat and then feel sad about it.  Living animals rendered into delicious dinner at my own hand rattles me and there lies the hypocrisy.   ""I weep for you, "" the Walrus said, ""I deeply sympathize.""  It was mussels. 

I had a coupon for a dollar off from the seafood department at the grocer's; lobsters on ice waved feebly in hopes of homicide to put them out of their misery, others in the tank were livelier and higher priced.  If I ever kill a lobster again, it will happen only with vast amounts of alcohol saucing the cook-murderer.  The last one, with all the assurances of primitive nervous systems by instructive how-to's, fought back, at least I think it did.  I nipped the spinal cord, split the head in two, put it in a pail of vodka to make it drunk, yet when dunking it headfirst into the boiling mass, the poor, half-chopped up beast heard the calvary call and rallied, legs a-waving, trying to climb out of the pot. Lord, I cried.  Ate him, but cried through the butter. 

But on a display made to look like a wooden dock were bags of mussels; now, I love shellfish but am often relegated to canned because I hate to kill them.  Canned this and thats are turned into food; smoked oysters, minced clams, scraped out of their shells and prepared by someone else.  Do you think a carrot screams when pulled from the soil?  Oh boy, maybe, thinks I.  There is a division of vegan that only consumes fruit, aptly named fruitarians, who work with the idea that fruit wants to be eaten since it is produced by the plant as a method of reproduction.  The apple, pear, peach or grape is given to us as part of a universe based on love that doesn't require destruction of the host plant or animal.  This appeals to me, yet I imagine a diet of only fruit and nuts would someday provoke a morning fight between me and the cats when the pop tab cracked open on the succulent salmon meow puree.  I'd spread it on nut flour toast, just for a bit of fish. 

The part where I would be the one responsible for sizzling the blue-shelled mussels did occur to me in the store.  I thought, nahhh, grow up, you can do this, and the ocean salt they carried ignited the desire for fresh; I could smell the Atlantic as I drove home.  Everything is eaten by something else, I rationalized, usually in a brutal manner. How am I different?  One of the shells was partially open, so I tapped and it shut: someone was home and definitely alive.  Crap.

Scrubbing them was sad, spreading them in the baking dish and blanketing them with olive oil and butter bothered me.  What did they think was happening?  Could I put them in the freezer so they would go to sleep before I put them in the oven?  Since they don't have brains, do they have tenure at the university?  There is a sea squirt that swims till it finds a rock to cling to; once anchored, it no longer needs the ganglia associated with movement, so it then eats its own ""brain"" for nutrition.  What is the problem, sensitive human?

Recent science says that human development was brought back from extinction by groups living near the ocean, whose seafood diet was more stable than that of the inland carnivores who had to run and catch game.  Our large brain size is being debated as a possible result of the essential brain nutrients found in shellfish, a richer source than red meat.  Omega-three fatty acids and high protein gave the advantage, besides the less dangerous risk of gathering shellfish compared to skinning a sabertooth.  The idea of time may have been supported by watching the tides ebb and flow, giving the idea of when to gather clams would be best.  Middens, which are mounds of shells, are found in coastal areas around the world and are sometimes over nine meters deep.   Knowing this doesn't make buttering and baking them easier.

What did make it better was covering the dish with foil, putting their solemn blue shells out of sight and into the oven.  I left the kitchen so any hissing liquid noises or screaming would not be heard, and watched the clock.  After, lifting the foil released aromas of broth and butter, garlic and parsley, and there is now leftover mussel broth in the freezer for later soup.  They were delicious, the shells clattered and made a pile on newspaper, the cat played with one scuttering across the kitchen floor.  I scrubbed a few to keep as examples of bivalves for class, and tossed the rest into the garbage chute. Primitive thing in a shell, what have I turned into? 

Supper is over, night has slipped into place.  Tulip is half on my lap, head resting on the arm of the sofa, and she is a furry hot water bottle warming me this cooler evening, before the apartment complex has turned on any heat.  Min is snoring behind us in her perch on the bookshelf, and there is broccoli soup cooling in the kitchen that needs to be put away.

Once eventually the steaming repast is presented, along with thick toasted slices of cheese-encrusted bread made by one's baker, one must then partake of a generous serving of said soup, and indeed one may well discover the hitherto unknown joys of the delicious concoction (albeit French), and request a further large serving.

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

*Please vote accordingly and report any uglies*

1/4 cup spicy ketchup

1/4 cup Sriracha mayo

1/4 cup buffalo mayo

TINY bit of spicy jalapeno juice

A teaspoon or 2 of Worcestershire sauce

TINNNYYY bit of sweet relish (like a dab)

Less than 1/4 cup boars head mustard (that's what brings it together)

1 or 2 tablespoons lemon juice (prob 1, 1.5)

MIX AGAIN AND ADD THE FOLLOWING:

A decent amount of blackened seasoning to add smokiness

Black garlic to add a unique sweetness and for visual flare

A good amount of onion powder

A good amount of the Kickin' Chicken seasoning to punch up the flavor and bring everything to life 

Garlic powder.... (More garlic powder than onion powder)

MIX AGAIN (AGAIN) AND ADD THE FOLLOWING:

Rainbow peppercorns (that you can grind, important for taste and visual)

A generous amount of white pepper

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

Interesting. It seems like the only downside he mentions is the potential use of chemicals in the process of refining oil.

aroma,d3olyoi,comment,"Okay.  This answer is a two part answer with sub answers.
1- When they cook their steaks immediately with too much time left in the round it's either editing or the contestant.  Sometimes editors like to show the action of sizzle and fire right away to keep the viewer engaged.  So they only put the highlights and sometimes those highlights are out of order, so it really helps having and editor and post producer who know something about food, because they are making those cuts without ever having been there for the actual filming.  More often it's the contestant, which can be good and bad.  The good part is searing the steaks immediately and resting them off to the side so you can finish them in the oven when the time gets close to being done.  That way you are not overwhelmed with too many things to do at the end when trying to plate.  You'll see this on shows and the process often doesn't get talked about in airing.  The latter is the contestant is just fucking up and cooking their steaks way too early.  We try and let judges know if they miss(which they rarely do) it to comment on it, but that doesn't always make the cut either.  The culinary staff on set is usually going nuts, asking why they are doing that so early.

2- Keeping the food ready to be eaten.  Okay so this is also a two part.  So, when the contestants on shows plate up, they usually make more than one. Often three or four, five and six.  Each show varies on how they do this, so I can't speak for Master Chef but it's usually one of these variations.   Immediately after the round ends plates get flown out to the judges, they eat the food hot off camera and take notes.  Then when the cameras reset to film the judging they eat the other plates which are cold and give their feedback from the original hot plates that were tasted.  You do this because resetting cameras takes some time and tasting takes some time.  So if it's 3 judges, six plates can get made and 3 are eaten hot and three are eaten cold.  I have also seen 3 judges and four plates, where the judges share a single plate of hot food and then they taste three cold on camera.  The other side of this is that sometimes they just eat cold food, no multiples.  Or the plates are placed in a warming box held until they are ready to be eaten.  The real twist in all of this is sometimes one of those plates is taken to beauties, which is where they shoot the long close ups beauty shots of each dish.  Often there is a separate camera crew and food stylist standing by to do that right after the cooking round is done.

Okay that was a long answer.  Hope it made sense.",5,2,False,1464568672.0,RegulatorsMountUp,0.9936569405580985,0.16666666666666666,0.1656094900930164,0.9761,0.1616514232797933,2.1616514232797934,d3o627o

Most people I know (myself included) have a large pot dedicated to making popcorn (the pot tends to get burnt stuff stuck to the bottom of it). Also, I like the burnt bits (and I know some others do too) so it's not true that nobody likes burnt popcorn. I see now that this is an Alton Brown recipe, I don't understand the rationale for using a metal bowl and I've never heard it recommended before.

Another noodle soup dish is curry beef.  Sometimes you can get this without noodles and with a great crusty French baguette, or even both!  It's great to dip the bread into the curry broth.

I don't know if you'll be able to find any places in the Baltimore area that would serve these dishes but VA isn't that far away, particularly the Falls Church area which I believe has a large Vietnamese population and probably lots of options.

I'm really a soup alchemist, I make it more than any other thing, but these above are my standards and always a favorite with family. I make the collard green soup every time I'm sick -- pot likker is the best cure all of all time. 

When my sister had surgery and couldn't keep anything down, I asked what she wanted and she said ""Your collard greens and cornbread"" and that perked her up right quick.


COLLARD GREEN SOUP

* 1 large bag of cut and cleaned mixed greens (see note)
* 1 large carton or can of low sodium chicken broth (at least one quart)
* 1 large bottle of Ale or Beer (see note)
* 1 onion (or 2 shallots)
* 3 slices of bacon
* garlic
* olive oil
* vinegar (see note)
* sea salt
* cayenne pepper or similar seasonings (see note)
* Fully cooked rotisserie turkey breast or chicken, quantity to your taste, 

Notes:

I typically use one large bag of Trader Joe's Southern Blend, but for this recipe, I used Cut N Clean Country Greens (collard, mustard, turnip) from a grocery store. You could use all of one kind if you like, but I like a blend.

I used a large 550 ml bottle of Samuel Smith Lager Beer from Trader Joe's

I used Trader Joe's White Balsamic, but any vinegar will work.

I ordinarily use cayenne pepper, but I also like Penzey's Northern Blend, which was so good, I may use it from now on.

Instructions:

In a large stock pot, make a swirl over most of the bottom with extra virgin olive oil. Heat and add one finely diced or shredded onion, several garlic cloves, a dash of sea salt, 3 slices of bacon, cut up, and your choice of spice seasonings. Saute until beginning to brown, and add sliced, fully cooked chicken or turkey. Continue to saute until all the ingredients are soft, browned, and aromatic. To the pot, add one full can or carton (1 quart at least) of chicken broth, and 1 bottle of ale or beer, and bring to a boil. When at a rolling boil, add one bag of cleaned and cut up country greens. Press greens into boiling mixture and dunk until they wilt and are covered with liquid. Put a lid on it, reduce heat, and let simmer for one hour or more, until greens are fully tender. Splash with vinegar to bring out the balance of the dish (not much is required and you won't taste it). You may want to adjust by adding more water or broth to keep the liquid level up, but I like the condensed, reduced version for flavor.

Slurp it up with a spoon, being sure to have soft bread or cornbread to sop up my favorite part -- the pot likker.",1,3,False,1354644348.0,condimentia,0.059790099293370036,0.5,0.029895049646685018,0.9821,0.029359928258009354,3.0293599282580095,1495f1

aroma,c7bh8wp,comment,"Since some of us are posting recipes this is how I made my last chicken noodle soup. 

I started off making a couple of roast chickens that was pretty close to [this recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/perfect-roast-chicken-recipe/index.html) I did not use fennel, added leaks, and also coated the outside of the birds with a grinder thing of Rosemary/Garlic seasoning. We had this for dinner only eating a bit of the breasts. I put pretty much everything that I could fit left over and the juices it made in the roaster into the crock pot adding a can of chicken broth and water as far to the top as I could get. 

Let it go over night on low then when ready to eat put in a large stock pot add noodles and slurp. ",1,1,False,1354687143.0,uologan,0.06159902113867329,0.5,0.030799510569336646,0.8779,0.02703889032882064,1.0270388903288206,1495f1

[Las Delicias De Michoacan](http://www.yelp.com/biz/las-delicias-de-michoacan-long-beach) on Magnolia and 8th in downtown Long Beach, CA. It's like this weird little taqueria in a tiny Mexican convenience market. Fucking epic burritos, five dollars and made right in front of your face. Best Mexican food I've ever had for any price. No one speaks English though, which is always a good sign for ethnic food. Be very clear if you can't handle spicy food, because if you don't ask them to turn down the heat, it is very HOT. But, you're not a pussy, right? 


[Sistah's Soul Food](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sistahs-soul-food-long-beach) in Long Beach, on the corner of Martin Luther King and PCH. They have a different menu every day of the week, but I most recommend going on a Saturday, which is barbeque day. The ribs are awesome. The sides are awesome. The desserts are awesome. Everything is super deadly. Lunch orders are about seven bucks and could probably feed two average persons. Sistah is really nice, too! They also have a ""5 dolla holla"" option as like a value meal, but I've never gotten it because I feel too embarrassed saying the word ""holla.""

polyphenols,1ew63wm,submission,"If anti-nutrients are of such concern, why not just consume more of the nutrients they inhibit? For example: phytate, oxalates and polyphenols bind to calcium, magnesium, iron, copper and zinc so they prevent them from being absorbed in the intestines, and glucosinolates prevent the uptake of iodine. Their effects don’t seem negligible because for instance, [the European Food Safety Authority recommends consuming more zinc in a high phytate diet](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3844).

But anti-nutrients only inhibit uptake of minerals to a certain extent, not completely. So doesn’t it just suffice to consume more of said minerals, like the EFSA recommends for zinc, as part of a healthy, balanced diet (and perhaps through supplementation)? We can also use preparation techniques like soaking, fermenting and sprouting that considerably reduce the amounts of anti-nutrients.

So unlike some proponents make it out to be, it really doesn’t seem to me like there is a case for cutting out grains (whether whole or not), legumes, vegetables and seeds out of our diets.

*""Blueberries and other foods topping the list were heavily promoted as disease fighters even if the science was weak.""*

>The USDA provided an ORAC database on its website highlighting foods with high ORAC scores, including cocoa, berries, spices, and legumes. Blueberries and other foods topping the list were heavily promoted as disease fighters even if the science was weak, from cancer to brain health to heart disease. However, 20 years later the USDA retracted the information and removed the database after determining that antioxidants have many functions, not all of which are related to free radical activity. [6] Despite the retraction, blueberry production in the U.S. doubled from 1998-2006, and has continued to increase every year through 2016 according to USDA data. [7]<

But they continue to fool people. Michael Greger is big on high-antioxidant foods and diets, but they might have little or no real benefit. 

And polyphenols have also be questioned.

CAVEAT: Recent studies attempting to show **causality** failed to do so (while still being limited by small sample sizes), so it's possible that the beneficial effects actually come from healthier lifestyles and diets that are associated with high coffee consumption.

Non-linear inverse associations between coffee consumption and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancers were found. The **lowest relative risk (RR) was at intakes of 3.5 cups/day for all-cause mortality (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.89)**, 2.5 cups/day for CVD mortality (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.80-0.87), and 2 cups/day for cancer mortality (RR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99), while additional intakes were not associated with further lower mortality.

Instead, a dual association was observed in bladder, gastric, pancreatic, and lung cancer, although only a few publications demonstrated this association. Surprisingly, we found that only 12 publications showed positive associations between cancer and coffee consumption (bold rows), as observed in a few types of cancer, including lung, bladder, pancreatic, laryngeal, and gastric cancer.

> The contribution of oxygen radical scavenging by coffee constituents to health effects is apparently small.
>
> Coffee is a plant food and **the majority of dietary phenolics consumed in the developed world come from coffee**.
>
> It is suggested that phenolic constituents of coffee exhibit similar health promoting effects as those from vegetables or fruits.
>
> The main pathway of health effects of phenolic phytochemicals from plant food, as well as from coffee, is **the activation of the Nrf2 system for an adaptive cytoprotective response**. Nrf2-dependent genes code for proteins with antioxidative, detoxifying, DNA repair or anti-inflammatory functions.

> Roasting of green coffee increases the ability to activate the Nrf2 pathway. In addition to this, **dark roast coffee is more potent in that regard than light roast coffee**, when analyzed in vivo [68,70,71].

[Neuroprotective Effects of Coffee Bioactive Compounds: A Review (Socała 2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7795778/)

> Importantly, coffee consumption seems to be also correlated with **a decreased risk of developing some neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and dementia**.

> Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that coffee and its bioactive compounds exert neuroprotective effects suggesting their preventive and/or therapeutic potential for different neurodegenerative conditions (Figure 3). Among them, caffeine has been the most extensively investigated and **the beneficial [neuroprotective] effects of coffee consumption can be largely (but not solely) attributed to caffeine**. However, numerous reports show that other coffee compounds may independently produce neuroprotective effects indicating that decaffeinated coffee could be also very effective in neurodegenerative conditions. **Polyphenolic acids (i.e., chlorogenic acids and caffeic acid) and trigonelline appear to be the most promising**, but in contrast to caffeine, there is a lack of epidemiological studies or clinical reports on their protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases.

Now, on the flip side, most studies have failed to find evidence of *causality*:

[Mendelian Randomization Studies of Coffee and Caffeine Consumption (Cornelis 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213346/)

- 15+ MR studies provide no consistent support for causal role of coffee on risk of various diseases.

> Epidemiological studies also suggest coffee intake may reduce risk of CVD, CVD-mortality and all-cause mortality, but with greatest risk reduction with 3 to 5 cups/day (i.e., a non-linear association) [14]. Nordestgaard and Nordestgaard [43] examined all three of these outcomes in **112,509 Danes** and observed a **similar pattern of benefits associated with coffee consumption over a 6 year follow-up, but no evidence for causality**.

[Epigenome-wide association meta-analysis of DNA methylation with coffee and tea consumption (Karabegović 2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8121846/)

- EWAS study shows coffee (but not tea) changes DNA methylation (and thus gene expression) of 11 specific CpG sites, some of which have been causally associated (via MR analysis) to type 2 diabetes, BMI, WHR, cholesterol levels, CHD, triglycerides, fatty liver disease. However, when the investigators applied MR methods, there was insufficient statistical power / sample size to show that coffee consumption directly impacted the cg14476101 site (a key site).

polyphenols,kzdqh1,submission,"Am I missing something with berries and vitamin C? So I went down the rabbit hole of how Polyphenols block iron absorption, and then read how vitamin C's iron absorption boosting capabilities that everyone knows about can outweigh/counteract the polyphenols impact. It listed higher doses of vitamin C to achieve this desired end result but I realized something: berries are pretty dang high in polyphenols, and although the internet likes to say they're high in vitamin C, they really aren't that high of a dose for this polyphenol-iron relationship according to everything I'm reading on Google scholar:

>The aims of this study were to examine whether small amounts of EGCG, GSE and green tea extract (GT) could inhibit heme iron absorption, and to test whether the inhibitory action of polyphenols could be offset by ascorbic acid. A heme-55Fe absorption study was conducted by adding various concentrations of EGCG, GSE and GT to Caco-2 cells in the absence and presence of ascorbic acid. Polyphenolic compounds significantly inhibited heme-55Fe absorption in a dose-dependent manner. **The addition of ascorbic acid did not modulate the inhibitory effect of dietary polyphenols on heme iron absorption when the cells were treated with polyphenols at a concentration of 46 mg/L. However, ascorbic acid was able to offset or reverse the inhibitory effects of polyphenolic compounds when lower concentrations of polyphenols were added (≤ 4.6 mg/L)**. Ascorbic acid modulated the heme iron absorption without changing the apical heme uptake, the expression of the proteins involved in heme metabolism and basolateral iron transport, and heme oxygenase activity, indicating that ascorbic acid may enhance heme iron absorption by modulating the intracellular distribution of 55Fe. These results imply that the regular consumption of dietary ascorbic acid can easily counteract the inhibitory effects of low concentrations of dietary polyphenols on heme iron absorption but cannot counteract the inhibitory actions of high concentrations of polyphenols.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/h9wzzh/potential_adverse_public_health_effects_afforded/

The article is here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254282/

>**Abstract:** Exposure of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich culinary oils (COs) to high temperature frying practices generates high concentrations of cytotoxic and genotoxic lipid oxidation products (LOPs) via oxygen-fueled, recycling peroxidative bursts. These toxins, including aldehydes and epoxy-fatty acids, readily penetrate into fried foods and hence are available for human consumption; therefore, they may pose substantial health hazards. Although previous reports have claimed health benefits offered by the use of PUFA-laden COs for frying purposes, these may be erroneous in view of their failure to consider the negating adverse public health threats presented by food-transferable LOPs therein. When absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) system into the systemic circulation, such LOPs may significantly contribute to enhanced risks of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), e.g. , cancer, along with cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Herein, we provide a comprehensive rationale relating to the public health threats posed by the dietary ingestion of LOPs in fried foods. We begin with an introduction to sequential lipid peroxidation processes, describing the noxious effects of LOP toxins generated therefrom. We continue to discuss GI system interactions, the metabolism and biotransformation of primary lipid hydroperoxide LOPs and their secondary products, and the toxicological properties of these agents, prior to providing a narrative on chemically-reactive, secondary aldehydic LOPs available for human ingestion. In view of a range of previous studies focused on their deleterious health effects in animal and cellular model systems, some emphasis is placed on the physiological fate of the more prevalent and toxic α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. We conclude with a description of targeted nutritional and interventional strategies, whilst highlighting the urgent and unmet clinical need for nutritional and epidemiological trials probing relationships between the incidence of NCDs, and the frequency and estimated quantities of dietary LOP intake.

TL;DR: This is a very large review of the evidence of frying oil degradation.

The practical conclusions are that polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs, omega 6 + omega 3), which are a large component of most vegetable oils, are the most reactive and unstable, producing ""lipid oxidation products"" including ""toxic aldehydes"", which have good evidence for being a major source of harm in the average diet. 

Thus, these oils really shouldn't be used for for deepfrying. Better choices would be ones that have low PUFA content, meaning high monounsaturated (olive, avocado, hi-oleic safflower) or high saturated (coconut, tallow). Oils degrade according to 4 factors: PUFA%, antioxidant/polyphenol content, temperature and time.  Smoke point doesn't appear to correlate with those parameters at all, so shouldn't be the primary way oils are judged.

Many nutrition authorities recommend eating more polyunsaturated fat vegetable oils because they lower cholesterol, however according to this new evidence, that really shouldn't apply to deep fryers!

Phytochemicals also promote intestinal homeostasis by improving gut barrier integrity and short-chain fatty acid production and by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota.

Caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and exercise activate defensive cellular responses such as autophagy, DNA repair, and the induction of antioxidant enzymes. These processes improve health and longevity by protecting cells and organs against damage, mutations, and reactive oxygen species. Consuming a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and mushrooms can also improve health and longevity. Phytochemicals such as alkaloids, polyphenols, and terpenoids found in plants and fungi activate the same cellular processes as caloric restriction, fasting, and exercise.

* Sencha green tea loose leaf was the winner at 15(mg GAE/(g·min). 

* English breakfast tea did great too with 10(mg GAE/(g·min) which is similar to peppermint and some of the green teas that aren't Sencha.

* Roiboos were disappointing at ~3(mg GAE/(g·min). You need 5 roiboos tea to get the same health benefit as one Sencha green tea.

* Chamomile SUCKS. Loose leaf is 1.8(mg GAE/(g·min). Chamomile tea bags are 1.1!

Oils are processed foods by definition and should therefore be used in strict moderation as they offer very little nutrition in regard to their extreme caloric content.

Now there exists a lot of confusion about the 'healthfulness' of different types of oil. Extra virgin olive oil is generally believed to be the best choice. Canola is often made out to be the devil because it's too industrial and associated with levels of trans fat, or because it has been subject to biotechnological interventions. Then there is avocado oil, which is supposedly better, and sunflower oil, which is seen as inferior due to its high omega-6 content.

So I thought I'd compare all these oils and look at their fatty acid composition, omega ratios and vitamin content. Because sunflower oil will definitely get bashed for its omega-6 content, I will use high-oleic sunflower oil in this comparison.

I use data from the nutrition facts labels in my local supermarket, supplemented with data from the NCCDB. These numbers can differ depending on the country where the oil crops are grown and what cultivars are used.

TL;DR:

- The loss of Vitamin E and the amount of fat oxidised is dependent on how long and hard we cook foods

- Vitamin C contents are spared by heating vegetables in the microwave compared to boiling (furthermore frozen vegetables have higher micronutrient contents, as suggested by other studies. Heating frozen veggies in the microwave may be the optimal solution)

- Some B-vitamins are spared due to shorter cooking times in microwaves

- Microwave cooking is the best way to eliminate germs and bacteria

- Avoid heating foods in plastic containers because harmful substances, such as PFUAs, may leak into the food

> ABSTRACT

> The use of microwave oven provides a convenient way to thaw, cook or reheat foods nowadays. Safety of microwave cooking of food is still the subject of research. Wave of interest is caused on the one hand the emergence of new research methods that enable detailed characterization of the processes occurring in the food under the influence of microwaves, on the other hand, - to clarify the influence of the individual components of the diet (trans-fatty acids, the products of oxidation of fats and lipids, conjugated alpha linolenic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and others) on human health. Analysis of the collected information on the effect of microwaves on the quality of the vegetable oils, fat component of food, as well as the preservation of water-soluble vitamins and vitamin E is presented. 

> **Most studies show that the loss of vitamin E and the formation of fat oxidation prod¬ucts are directly dependent on the power used, and the microwave heating time. Microwaves exposure on fat and fatty foods during less than 3 minutes at average power 500 watts is minimal. Nutritional value of dishes cooked using microwave ovens and using traditional cooking methods are comparable.** Information about the use as natural antioxidants polyphenols from various plant extracts (olive leaves, lavender, green and white tea, etc.) is presented. **Content of vitamin С in vegetables cooked in a microwave oven is higher than by boiling or baking in most cases. Vitamins (B h B2, niacin) retention in microwaved foods is equal or better than conventionally prepared foods because of the shorter heating time. Chemical (formation of carcinogens) and microbiological risks associated with microwave cooking, is often lower than in traditional cooking.** **Microwave cooking (if cooking time required to reach the proper temperature, and power) provides the most complete destruction of germs and worms.** **The microwave cook of food should be done only in specially designed for this purpose container in connection with the possibility of migration of chemicals from materials in that heats food.** *[Note: she's talking about PFUAs and why you shouldn't heat food in plastics].* 

> Negative influence of microwave cooking food on the functional state of an organism is not revealed. Thus, differences in the nutritional value of dishes prepared using the microwave and traditional way, are minimal. Nevertheless, the possible influence of heat treatment on the keeping quality of the fat components (modules) for fortified and functional foods, especially semi-finished products or products to be thawed and/ or heating should be taken into account.

polyphenols,2p7njy,submission,"no food compounds have been proved with antioxidant efficacy in vivo. why? according to wikipedia.

> In the following discussion, the term ""antioxidant"" refers mainly to non-nutrient compounds in foods, such as polyphenols, which have antioxidant capacity in vitro and so provide an artificial index of antioxidant strength – the ORAC measurement. Other than for dietary antioxidant vitamins – vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E – no food compounds have been proved with antioxidant efficacy in vivo. Accordingly, regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration of the United States and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have published guidance disallowing food product labels to claim an inferred antioxidant benefit when no such physiological evidence exists.

how come antioxidants are proved to work in vivo?

> Not like controlled test tube conditions, the fate of flavones or polyphenols in vivo shows they are poorly conserved (less than 5%), with most of what is absorbed existing as metabolites modified during digestion and destined for rapid excretion

> Despite the above discussion implying that ORAC-rich foods with polyphenols may provide antioxidant benefits when in the diet, there remains no physiological evidence that any polyphenols have such actions or that ORAC has any relevance in the human body.

> On the contrary, research indicates that although polyphenols are good antioxidants in vitro, antioxidant effects in vivo are probably negligible or absent.[5][6][7] By non-antioxidant mechanisms still undefined, polyphenols may affect mechanisms of cardiovascular disease or cancer.[8]

polyphenols,2ezht3,submission,"What's New and Beneficial About Strawberries! Many foods commonly consumed in the U.S. are valuable sources of antioxidants. But researchers have recently ranked the 50 best antioxidant sources among commonly eaten foods and found strawberries to be quite exceptional. When total antioxidant capacity was measured against a uniform amount of food (100 grams, or about 3.5 ounces), strawberries ranked 27th best among U.S. foods. In addition, when only fruits were considered, strawberries came out 4th among all fruits (behind blackberries, cranberries, and raspberries). However, since many foods (for example, spices and seasonings) are seldom consumed in amounts as large as 3.5 ounces, researchers also looked at common serving sizes for all foods and their total antioxidant capacity. In this evaluation based on common serving sizes, strawberries came out 3rd among all U.S. foods including spices, seasonings, fruits, and vegetables! (In this analysis based on serving size, only blackberries and walnuts scored higher in total antioxidant capacity.) When we hear the word ""strawberry,"" we might think about a very commonplace fruit. But the antioxidant capacity of strawberry is anything but common!


Recent research has shown strawberries to be a surprisingly fragile, perishable, and delicate fruit. Food scientists recently took a close look at storage time, storage temperature, storage humidity, and degree of strawberry ripeness and found significant differences between different types of strawberry storage. On average, studies show 2 days as the maximal time for strawberry storage without major loss of vitamin C and polyphenol antioxidants. It's not that strawberries become dangerous to eat or invaluable after 2 days. It's just that more storage time brings along with it substantially more nutrient loss. In terms of humidity, 90-95% has been shown optimal. Most refrigerators will average a much lower humidity (between 80-90%). Because air circulation inside the fridge can lower humidity, you may want to give your strawberries more storage humidity by putting them in your refrigerator's cold storage bins (if available). Those cold storage bins will help boost humidity by reducing air circulation. If your fridge does not have storage bins, you can use a sealed container for refrigerator storage of your strawberries. Optimal temperature for strawberry storage over a 2-day period has been found to be relatively cold—36F (2C). All public health organizations recommend refrigerator temperatures of 40F (4.4C) as the maximum safe level for food storage. However, if you are storing sizable amounts of fruits and vegetables—including strawberries—in your refrigerator, you may want to consider setting your refrigerator to a lower-than-maximum temperature setting in the range of 36-38F (2-3C). In terms of ripeness, recent studies have found that both underripeness and overripeness can have an unexpectedly large impact on the phytonutrient content of strawberries, especially their antioxidant polyphenols. Fortunately, optimal strawberry ripeness can be judged by color. You'll want to consume your strawberries when their amazing pinkish-red color is most vibrant and rich in luster.


Improved blood sugar regulation has been a long-standing area of interest in research on strawberries and health. However, scientists have recently discovered a fascinating relationship between intake of strawberries, table sugar, and blood sugar levels. As you might expect, excess intake of table sugar (in a serving size of 5-6 teaspoons) can result in an unwanted blood sugar spike. But you might not expect this blood sugar spike to be reduced by simultaneous consumption of strawberries! Yet that's exactly what researchers have discovered. With the equivalent of approximately one cup of fresh strawberries (approximately 150 grams), blood sugar elevations from simple sugar intake can be reduced. These health science researchers have further speculated that polyphenols in strawberries played a major role in helping regulate blood sugar response. This finding is great news for healthy persons wanting to maintain healthy blood sugar levels, and also for persons with type 2 diabetes who enjoy fresh strawberries and want to enjoy them on a regular basis.


Given their amazing combination of phytonutrients—including anthocyanins, ellagitannins, flavonols, terpenoids, and phenolic acids—it's not surprising to find increasing research interest in the anti-inflammatory properties of strawberries. But it's still exciting to see this remarkable fruit lowering levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) when consumed several days per week in everyday amounts of approximately one cup. Recent research has shown that several blood markers for chronic, unwanted inflammation can be improved by regular intake of strawberries. Interestingly, in one large-scale study, consumption of strawberries did not show anti-inflammatory benefits until strawberries were consumed at least 3 times per week. This research is one of the reasons we recommend inclusion of berries at least 3-4 times per week in your overall fruit intake.",0,2,True,1409377704.0,retin,0.06099404914334028,1.0,0.06099404914334028,0.9992,0.0609452539040256,2.0609452539040256,

polyphenols,1va1bn,submission,"Top 10 foods that fight pain Chronic inflammation is often the main cause of pain and what we eat can influence that condition. Our body is alkaline by design, but our diet and lifestyle often causes it to become acid – and acidity is a trigger for inflammation. Foods that can help fight pain are those that help reduce harmful chronic inflammation and redress the acid/alkaline balance in the body.

1. Dark green vegetables

Dark green vegetables, including broccoli, cabbage and Brussels sprouts contain a phytonutrient known as sulphoraphane that helps prevent the activation of inflammatory enzymes and also stops these enzymes from increasing. Broccoli also contains salicylic acid, the active pain-relieving ingredient in aspirin, so it works well as a pain reliever. These veges help make us more alkaline so eating them regularly, lightly cooked or raw, will help keep the body from becoming acidic.

2. Berries and cherries

Berries and cherries are full of natural pain-relievers and joint-healing substances. They are nature’s richest sources of anthocyanins, a group of antioxidants called flavonoids which possess exceptional anti-inflammatory properties. That’s why blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, boysenberries, loganberries, strawberries and cherries top the list of anti-arthritis fruits.

3. Fish

Fish is a great pain reliever and certain varieties, including salmon, mackerel, herring, scallops, tuna, sardines and anchovies possess natural compounds that can stop inflammation, relieve pain, and encourage your arthritic joints to produce new cartilage. The oily fish in particular contain omega 3 fatty acids which play a big part in relieving inflammation, thereby helping to reduce pain.

4. Nuts

Nuts contain antioxidants, omega 3 fatty acids and magnesium which all work together to help reduce inflammation in the body. Brazil nuts and walnuts contain more of the trace mineral, selenium, an important anti-oxidant that helps to limit free radical damage.

5. Flaxseed

Flaxseed contains a rich supply of alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), one of the omega 3 fatty acids, and is the very best plant source of healing omega 3s, with each tablespoon of ground flaxseed containing about 1.8 grams of plant omega 3. The lignans and fibre in flaxseed add to its nutritional value and health benefits. Flaxseed could also be beneficial for acne, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease and symptoms of menopause.

6.  Citrus fruits

Citrus fruits are surprisingly, alkaline foods. They are high in antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E, and healing phytonutrients, including hesperitin and a variety of polyphenols, which are good anti inflammatories. When eating an orange and other citrus fruits, it is important to eat as much of the inner white pulp as possible as this is where much of the healing properties of the flavanone herperidin are contained.

7. Papaya

The fruit of the papaya tree is loaded with antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin A. It also contains a proteolytic enzyme, papain, which acts as an anti-inflammatory. Papain roams through the blood stream breaking down any inflammation and clearing it from the body. It can be obtained in either powder or capsule form, is at its most concentrated in under-ripe or green papaya, and is often combined with bromelain, a beneficial enzyme found in pineapple.

8. Apples

Apples are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, such as vitamin C and polyphenolic compounds, which block the damage caused by free radicals, therefore building the immune system.

9. Ginger

Ginger, either as a tea or grated over your stirfry has potent anti-inflammatory benefits. It can also be used to treat migraine headaches. A study published in the ‘Phytotherapy Research’ journal compared the effectiveness of ginger and the drug sumatriptan (also known as Imigran) in treating migraine symptoms. One hundred patients, all of whom had acute migraine without aura (migraine without early symptoms), were randomly given either ginger powder or sumatriptan. The results found the effect of ginger powder on migraines were similar to the drug sumatriptan but adverse effects were less.

10. Tumeric

Tumeric is a yellow spice widely used for colour and flavouring and is perhaps best known as an ingredient in Indian curry dishes. It has long been regarded for its powerful anti-inflammatory effects due to the active ingredient, curcumin. Curcumin helps lower the levels of two enzymes in the body that cause inflammation and has been shown to work as well as ibuprofen in treating pain. It also has antioxidant properties. Tumeric has also been used to treat digestive and liver problems, skin diseases and wounds.",0,29,True,1389799112.0,Nutrexp,0.2390518184027491,1.0,0.2390518184027491,0.9986,0.23871714585698528,29.238717145856985,

polyphenols,18cs0m,submission,"A Note on Calories and A Common Misconception I've noticed in a few comments that the idea that caloric intake is a substantial determinant in body composition is being cited. I just wanted to take the time to talk about how diet effects body composition, and what the importance of calories really are in this topic.

First off, body composition is a measure of fat mass to lean mass, fat mass simply being fat (or adipose tissue to be technical) with lean mass being everything that is not fat (organs, bones, water). 

The prevalent idea is that an excess intake of calories, meaning consuming more calories than you burn on average, leads to an increase in body fat. This logic is flawed.

Calories are a unit of energy and *not* a nutrient, they have no physical form unlike, for example, fat which is essentially a long string of carbons with hydrogens attached to them. 

Now onto the good stuff...

When you eat food, you are consuming a myriad of macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) and other chemicals (phytochemicals, antioxidants, polyphenols and many more). Macronutrients contain Calories in the sense that our bodies can manipulate their chemical structure to release energy that we can use to do work (in the physical sense).

Eating food which contains calories (pretty much anything obviously) causes those ""calories"" to go somewhere. The calories don't physically *go* anywhere, as they have no physical form; what is happening is the form that they are contained in is repurposed into another form for either energy production or energy storage.

Let's use a banana to exemplify this. A banana contains the majority of it's calories in carbohydrates. Eating the banana, after digestion and absorption, leave these carbohydrates as the simple sugar glucose. This glucose can then do several things it can be

*mobilized for energy (we'll rule this out, as we are talking about a calorically excessive diet)

*stored as glycogen (a glucose polymer) in the muscles or liver to be used later

*stored in another form, such as fat or protein, after being converted to a  suitable form, with other substances being required to do this

The point to this is that this banana, and the calories that came with it, can be used in multiple ways, with fat accumulation being only one of those possibilites. What determines how these calories will be stored is more a matter of hormonal regulation than of simple caloric intake.

Certain foods have a propensity to leave their calories distributed one way or another; soda will likely cause an increase in body fat due to the hormonal involvement that results from drinking soda. Taking in an excess 250 calories of soda (sugar) will likely make you fat. Taking in excess 250 calories of something nutrient dense, let's say eggs (and let's not get started with the cholesterol fears) will cause a completely different hormonal response in your body due to the difference in the makeup of the food, chemically speaking. If you are a completely sedentary person that extra 250 calories from the eggs probably will contribute to some increase in body fat, however if you are an active person (but not so active as to create calorie balance or a calorie deficit) those 250 calories from the egg will be more likely to going to a process like protein synthesis than the sugar from the soda.

One last quick example. Think of a kid going through puberty. He can take in a significant amount of calories more than he burns and not get fat. These calories are used not to make more fat, but to allow him to physically grow. This example is extreme in the sense that puberty is relatively short and most people are not experiencing that rate of linear growth, however it illustrates that excess calories are not specifically targeted for fat, they just go there if you have no reason to do anything else with them (you sit around on the couch all day) or you eat unhealthy food that is chemically designed to be stored as fat.

Basically, the idea that excess calories *always* causes an increase in fat *and only fat* is not true, and is a common misconception when it comes to nutrition so I wanted to try and clear this up. (edit italics)

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

 When you eat foods high in phytic acid, the molecules bind with certain minerals in your digestive tract, including: 

Calcium

Magnesium

Iron

Zinc

Chromium

Manganese 

Once this occurs, your body no longer has access to these nutrients.
Generally, the more phytic acid you eat, the more minerals are blocked from your body.

However, recent studies have shown that phytic acid's anti-nutrient effect occurs only when large amounts of phytates are consumed within a diet that is already lacking nutrition. It also only affects the absorption of nutrients eaten at the same meal.

The anti-nutrient crowd is really about whole foods if you just listened to what they propose eating. They took their advice one step further because they realized that if all you do is consume a shitload of unprocessed food, you will hit other issues, like excess phytate or something.

Somewhere between people like them getting autistically concerned about anti-nutrients and people like you who are concerned with emphasizing the most basic of diet advice, you have the truth.

I see it like this:

The main ""anti-nutrients"" are the things which damage the inner body (which aren't necessarily observed as weight gain until after these organs have been damaged). These chief things are refined ingredients like sugar, flour, and oil. Sugar is a minor liver toxin, flour gets broken down into sugar too quickly, and polyunsaturated fats cause inflation, and inflation is the cousin of insulin resistance.

All of these things can be consumed in moderation, and there are superior variants of these things which limit the downsides. I think sourdough reduces some effects of flour. Fruit has sugar wrapped in fiber, so you won't have as many issues if you still consume it in moderation. For oil, just choose the oils that have good fat profiles (less of the inflammatory stuff).",2,-2,False,1724107159.0,LiftSleepRepeat123,0.30232560684029763,0.3333333333333333,0.1007752022800992,0.946,0.09533334135697384,-1.904666658643026,liwacrk

>We conclude that virtually no evidence is available from randomized, controlled intervention studies among healthy, noninfant human beings to show that addition of LA to the diet increases the concentration of inflammatory markers.

[Dietary intake and biomarkers of linoleic acid and mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000291652200778X)

>**Results:** Thirty-eight studies reporting 44 prospective cohorts were identified; these included **811,069 participants with dietary intake assessment (170,076 all-cause, 50,786 CVD, and 59,684 cancer deaths) and 65,411 participants with biomarker measurements** (9758 all-cause, 6492 CVD, and 1719 cancer deaths). Pooled RRs comparing extreme categories of dietary LA intake (high vs low) were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.94; I2= 67.9%) for total mortality, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.92; I2= 3.7%) for CVD mortality, and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.93; I2= 0%) for cancer mortality. Pooled RRs for each SD increment in LA concentrations in adipose tissue/blood compartments were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.95; I2= 64.1%) for total mortality, 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.94; I2= 28.9%) for CVD mortality, and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.98; I2= 26.3%) for cancer mortality. Meta-regressions suggested baseline age and dietary assessment methods as potential sources of heterogeneity for the association between LA and total mortality.

Polyphenol-rich extracts are used for the preservation of all-natural products. Phenolic compounds are found in fruits, spices and herbs. They have antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. We essentially protect food by using food.

Fun fact: this wasn’t done for some health benefits, either: 

“The Brits’ habit of putting milk in tea extends all the way back to the 18th century, from the time when tea was brewed in pots.

However, most people couldn’t afford fancy fine bone china, and the cups available would crack from the heat of the boiling hot tea.

The solution? Pour milk into the cup first, then add the tea. The cold milk cooled down the tea enough to keep the china from breaking, and well, the reduced bitterness was just an added benefit!

Black coffee or green tea to relax with after

For dessert can add in a scoop of a hydro whey for taste if need be

Pescatarians in the adventist health study 2 live longer then vegans and vegetarians and the head research on the simon hill podcast said newer pre published research was showing vegans had worse cognitive scores with age then pescatarians and that fermented dairy products like greek yogurt were not correlated with cancer like milk was

Not only do people's nutritional needs change based on lifestyle and circumstances, but on top of that people have allergies and food intolerances, and can have genetic factors that lead them to need more or less of (and tolerate more or less of) certain nutrients or antinutrients..

What would be perfect for one person might not be for another.

As a very tangible example, my dad is allergic to wheat, corn, oats, and legumes, which eliminates many of the staple foods (as well as many of the healthiest foods) that many people rely on. On the other hand, probably because he is descended from cold-climate people, he has no trouble with salt elevating his blood pressure so he's able to consume a lot more salt than some people, also he's able to consume milk products just fine, and he seems to have a very low genetic tendency towards high cholesterol and heart disease, so he's even able to eat more meat and processed meat than most people without showing any markers of heart disease.

My mom is different. She has no food allergies, but she has more tendency towards high cholesterol so she avoids eating meat to a greater degree than my dad. She loves beans and lentils and other legumes.

And then I know people who are very different. Some are lactose intolerant. One has celiac and can't have any gluten. The dad of one of my friends has type 2 diabetes and this restricts what he can eat. Another friend has type 1 diabetes which places very different constraints on him.

What is right for one person isn't necessarily right for another!

The servings are fairly big so it can be a full meal that comes with all the macronutrients and a huge amount of micronutrients. If you don't eat meat, cereals+legumes come close to the quality of animal protein and it's specially rich in fiber which a lot of meals often lack.

* Some whole grains

Dr Paul saladino has been pushing a meat based diet with added tropical fruits. One of the primary criticisms against carnivore is the stress of gluconeogenesis (the ray peat community talks about this a lot). 

Cravings go away after a few weeks typically so once you're through the initial hump it's not too hard except for socially. I recommend people add about 1/4 potassium chloride to their salt of choice taste as otherwise there can be electrolyte issues. 

As whole fruits can have fibers that feed the bad get bacteria (the main cause of most people's issues) using the good a2 grass-fed milk for your 90 carbs a day may be preferable if tolerated. Best way to figure it out is to just do meet only for a few weeks and then try stuff out. If you've ever done an extended fast and felt good about a weekend, you're going to feel about the same but with more energy eating this way.

Personally, my triglycerides fell to next to nothing, my hscrp went from 1.6 down to 0.6, I lost 90 lb without trying, and all of my GI and anxiety issues went away.

Smoking and soda are both fairly bad for the body (one more so by quite a lot, but both still not great). Drinking soda does not increase your chance of lung cancer in some profound way. Obesity might be a co morbidity, but it’s not a direct effect. In the same way, lead from the shipping process is not the same as ingesting pesticides. They kill you in different ways. 

Also not all food has toxic compounds, but enough do that it is unwise to eat the same thing for a large portion of your daily calories every day. 

You might *know for a fact* that your potatoes are above board. Then to crazy, they won’t hurt you. But most people can’t be so sure of their food sourcing because they just don’t have the time of knowledge to parse all the information. So the recommendation is to just try to vary your diet up as much as you can.

It really isn’t that serious that like eating more than three bell peppers will kill you, or that everything carries toxins. The recommendation is really to just not do something crazy like eating two whole chickens every single day for years on end.

I definitely agree there’s no use squaring off in debate if we all want the same thing, healthy people/planet etc. I also agree that lab grown meat is way better than our system now, I hope it includes fish too. There’s no way the entire human population can eat meat in the traditional means of production, be it regenerative or industrial, and have the planet stay in balance. So I’m all for lab grown. And when we have clean lab grown salmon I may even incorporate some into my diet. But until then, I am thriving off of a vegan diet that is strictly fruits, vegetables,  plant protein. I keep it low sodium and I supplement B12, creatine and algae dha. I don’t even think supplementing those is 100% necessary but it seems to make an incremental difference that is worth it for me.

>Not one that says you should limit meat intake or that plant-based diets are good, but one that says a purely plant-based diet cannot be improved by the addition of animal products (what I actually said).

Now read those studies again.

Take it slow. Think critically. Do any of them actually suggest the optimal diet contains no animal products (the claim in question)? 

The first only studies the gut microbiome, which is one aspect of health, and is inconclusive:

>it is still unclear whether a therapeutic vegan diet can be prescribed to alter the gut microflora for long-term health benefits

The second is a narrative review. It falls within the bottom rung of [this image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Hierarchy_of_Evidence.png) as an opinion paper, and as such is not admissible as scientific evidence. The author can be interpreted as contradicting my claim, just unfortunately with opinion rather than data:

>This review is  novel, as  it is the first to link scientific evidence 
to  relevant  anecdotal  information on  sport and vegan 
diets, but also bridges the gap between, translates and 
applies the rationale from excellent science to practical 
implications of this dual approach in settings  of every-
day life. **It should support vegan athletes in their desire 
to adopt the most sustainable diet for their health as a 
condition for performance.**

Back to an actual study:

>A vegan diet may have the potential for the prevention of cardiometabolic health, but it may also impair bone health. More well-conducted primary studies are warranted.

And the last one:

>However, eliminating all animal products from the diet increases the risk of certain nutritional deficiencies.

Regarding heavy metals in fish, your link didn't work, but there are also heavy metals (arsenic) in rice if you want to play that game. In both cases, they're negligible if you don't overrely on a single food source.

If anything, your provided studies have suggested that vegans should include animal products in their diet to avoid nutritional deficiencies and impairment of bone health.

**Do you think it's possible that your beliefs about nutrition are actually downstream of your vegan ideology, rather than the other way around?**

**Is it possible that you're not being honest with yourself, and that you *want* to believe a plant-based diet is nutritionally optimal, regardless of evidence, because holding that belief makes it easier to proselytise?**",11,2,False,1712482080.0,Apprehensive_Job7,0.06109899539059178,0.08333333333333333,0.005091582949215981,0.9498,0.004835985485165339,2.0048359854851654,kyg0r36
polyphenols,kx03u6m,comment,"#### About participation in the comments of /r/nutrition  

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

You need a little help to liberate them, mostly with human-compatible acid reactants. ascorbic acid citrate and lactate for example. Blending helps a bit as well

Oxalaltes and dairy isn't actually that big a deal, in part because the calcium bind with oxalate and become insoluble in the gut prevents absorption into the blood (although its still a problem in the gut).

The dietary guidelines in the US are rigorously based on science. The thing is, the vast, vast majority of people in the US do not meet those guidelines. 

I'm aware there may be certain biases from respective industries, but those guidelines are designed to meet the overwhelming majority of the population. I'm always perplexed by the obsession from people about micronutrients. The truth is, if you eat a varied diet from whole foods, you get a great blend of nutrients to meet your needs. You won't feel like a superhuman. You only markedly notice a difference if you're deficient in a nutrient. All those supplement bottles claiming to give you energy? Yea, sure. If you're deficient. The companies are technically using science to make that claim, but it's a little untruthful given the context.

Before anyone comes at me with downvotes, their own research, etc. I've seen the process, the methodology, and the amount of studies the US dietary guideline committee goes through. I bring this up, because if you only have one half of the story, it's difficult to understand the whole picture. They do change over time, and the guidelines are not necessarily infallible. I'm also not going to dispute how well they are presented or not presented to the public, because we all know how the US Food Pyramid went, lol.

Many nutrients are stored by the body and not needed daily. Some are. And what every person needs to obtain a ""perfect diet"" varies. No one can tell you what that is for you. 

I focus on a selection of whole foods and try to eat them every day (greens, legumes, whole grains, nuts/seeds, cruciferous veggies, fruits and then meat/yogurt/eggs). I focus on meals I can load nutritionally. Steel cut oats, for example, you can add a ton of stuff to, including things like ground sweet potato (which is way better than it might sound, lol). Buddha bowls where you can get half a day's worth of nutrients into one meal. Soups (I make my own broth). I aim for 90% of the time, meaning I try to follow my whole-foods diet about 27 days a month.

The glucose you need will be unlocked inside your own body, so no real need for carbs unless you're a major athlete. Your body should generate enough internally to be sufficient barring vitamin C, which we lost the ability to produce internally many years ago. That's just my understanding. I do supplement everyday with C, D, zinc, and a host of other minerals and bioflavonoids. I'm not a doctor, but I received this advice. I'm not dishing it out as an expert or anything, but there are experts like Dr Tim Noakes, who can provide greater clarity.

Malnutrition hasn't decreased from a global perspective. The prevalence of undernutrition may have decreased over time, but Malnutrition is a catch all term for under and overnourished. Just because undernutrition isn't prevalent in your daily life, doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and it doesn't mean it's not a problem for many people. I say these things, because if you look at international organizations, reputable academics, and the research, you'll see that the progress towards preventing undernutrition has stagnated compared to the first three quarters of the 20th century.

If you have time and/or the interest, I recommend checking out the triple burden of malnutrition. Attached is a link from UNICEF to get some foundational knowledge on the topic:

You sound like the type of person who eats a healthy balanced diet. My advice to you is to only act if you start feeling bad, sick, tired, inflammation or whatever. If your don't feel bad then don't change anything. It's going to be impossible for any human to optimize their diet 100% because we don't know how much each individual needs, because everyone is different and we probably haven't even discovered all nutrients yet. We discovered choline not too long ago and that one is relatively important, so just eat a balanced whole food diet.

Olive oil is a core part of the mediterranean diet:

https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/9/5371/htm

>Cooking processes can strongly influence antioxidant phytochemical levels in fruits vegetables and herbs [84,89]. Amongst the many ways of preparing vegetables, perhaps the most frequent and traditional way in Mediterranean cuisine is to present the vegetables in olive oil, either by cooking the vegetables in olive oil or by dressing the vegetables with raw oil. Olive oil enhances taste and acceptability and, it has been proposed, is an important reason for the high levels of consumption of vegetables in Mediterranean countries [90]. Another beneficial effect of EVOO is that when vegetables are cooked in this medium they may absorb significant levels of antioxidants from the oil [91]. In addition, the bioavailability and absorption of many phytochemicals in vegetables, especially carotenoids, is significantly enhanced and this may increase the health benefits. 

We're living in a new era now. It's 2020, fat isn't bad. Nutrition authorities around the world have removed older limits that said fat should be less than 30 or 35%, and are telling us that unsaturated fats should be encouraged.

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/healthy-dietary-styles/

>Low-fat fails: While low-fat was once the diet du jour, subsequent research has shown that low-fat diets are ineffective, and moreover, that eating healthy fats is beneficial for health.

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/

>“Good” unsaturated fats — Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — lower disease risk. Foods high in good fats include vegetable oils (such as olive, canola, sunflower, soy, and corn), nuts, seeds, and fish.

We are uncertain whether increasing omega-6 fats affects CVD mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.55, 472 deaths, 4019 randomised, 7 trials), coronary heart disease events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17, 1059 people with events of 3997 randomised, 7 trials), major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.20, 817 events, 2879 participants, 2 trials) or stroke (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.11, 54 events, 3730 participants, 4 trials), as we assessed the evidence as being of very low quality. We found no evidence of dose-response or duration effects for any primary outcome, but there was a suggestion of greater protection in participants with lower baseline omega-6 intake across outcomes.

Additional key outcomes: we found increased intake of omega-6 fats may reduce myocardial infarction (MI) risk (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02, 609 events, 4606 participants, 7 trials, low-quality evidence). High-quality evidence suggests increasing omega-6 fats reduces total serum cholesterol a little in the long term (mean difference (MD) −0.33 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.50 to −0.16, I2 = 81%; heterogeneity partially explained by dose, 4280 participants, 10 trials). Increasing omega-6 fats probably has little or no effect on adiposity (body mass index (BMI) MD −0.20 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.56 to 0.16, 371 participants, 1 trial, moderate-quality evidence). It may make little or no difference to serum triglycerides (MD −0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.23 to 0.21, 834 participants, 5 trials), HDL (MD −0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.02, 1995 participants, 4 trials) or low-density lipoprotein (MD −0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.14, 244 participants, 2 trials, low-quality evidence)...

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-6 fats on cardiovascular health, mortality, lipids and adiposity to date, using previously unpublished data. We found no evidence that increasing omega-6 fats reduces cardiovascular outcomes other than MI, where 53 people may need to increase omega-6 fat intake to prevent 1 person from experiencing MI. Although benefits of omega-6 fats remain to be proven, increasing omega-6 fats may be of benefit in people at high risk of MI. Increased omega-6 fats reduce serum total cholesterol but not other blood fat fractions or adiposity.“

“ Results: In 30 prospective studies with medians of follow-up ranging 2.5 to 31.9 years, 15 198 incident cardiovascular events occurred among 68 659 participants. Higher levels of LA were significantly associated with lower risks of total CVD, cardiovascular mortality, and ischemic stroke, with hazard ratios per interquintile range of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88-0.99), 0.78 (0.70-0.85), and 0.88 (0.79-0.98), respectively, and nonsignificantly with lower coronary heart disease risk (0.94; 0.88-1.00). Relationships were similar for LA evaluated across quintiles. AA levels were not associated with higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes; in a comparison of extreme quintiles, higher levels were associated with lower risk of total CVD (0.92; 0.86-0.99). No consistent heterogeneity by population subgroups was identified in the observed relationships.

Conclusions: In pooled global analyses, higher in vivo circulating and tissue levels of LA and possibly AA were associated with lower risk of major cardiovascular events. These results support a favorable role for LA in CVD prevention.”

“ Increasing PUFA probably makes little or no difference (neither benefit nor harm) to our risk of death (moderate-quality evidence), and may make little or no difference to our risk of dying from cardiovascular disease (low-quality evidence). However, increasing PUFA probably slightly reduces our risk of heart disease events and of combined heart and stroke events (moderate-quality evidence). Fifty three people would need to eat more PUFA to prevent one person experiencing a heart disease event, and 63 people to prevent one person experiencing a heart or stroke event. Increasing PUFA may very slightly reduce risk of death due to heart disease, as well as stroke, but harm is possible (low-quality evidence). PUFA probably slightly reduces fats circulating in the blood (triglycerides, moderate-quality evidence but without effects on other lipids or adiposity). The evidence mainly comes from dietary-advice trials of men living in high-income countries.

Authors' conclusions: 
This is the most extensive systematic review of RCTs conducted to date to assess effects of increasing PUFA on cardiovascular disease, mortality, lipids or adiposity. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events, may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease mortality and stroke (though not ruling out harms), but has little or no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. The mechanism may be via TG reduction.”

“ We included 49 RCTs randomising 24,272 participants, with duration of one to eight years. Eleven included trials were at low summary risk of bias, 33 recruited participants without cardiovascular disease. Baseline PUFA intake was unclear in most trials, but 3.9% to 8% of total energy intake where reported. Most trials gave supplemental capsules, but eight gave dietary advice, eight gave supplemental foods such as nuts or margarine, and three used a combination of methods to increase PUFA.

Increasing PUFA intake probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality (risk 7.8% vs 7.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07, 19,290 participants in 24 trials), but probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease events from 14.2% to 12.3% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 15 trials, 10,076 participants) and cardiovascular disease events from 14.6% to 13.0% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01, 17,799 participants in 21 trials), all moderate‐quality evidence. Increasing PUFA may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease death (6.6% to 6.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 9 trials, 8810 participants) andstroke (1.2% to 1.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44, 11 trials, 14,742 participants, though confidence intervals include important harms), but has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26, 16 trials, 15,107 participants) all low‐quality evidence. Effects of increasing PUFA on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and atrial fibrillation are unclear as evidence is of very low quality.

Increasing PUFA intake slightly reduces total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) ‐0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.23 to ‐0.02, 26 trials, 8072 participants) and probably slightly decreases triglycerides (MD ‐0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.20 to ‐0.04, 20 trials, 3905 participants), but has little or no effect on high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD ‐0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.01, 18 trials, 4674 participants) or low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD ‐0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.06, 15 trials, 3362 participants). Increasing PUFA probably causes slight weight gain (MD 0.76 kg, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.19, 12 trials, 7100 participants).

Effects of increasing PUFA on serious adverse events such as pulmonary embolism and bleeding are unclear as the evidence is of very low quality.

Authors' conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic review of RCTs conducted to date to assess effects of increasing PUFA on cardiovascular disease, mortality, lipids or adiposity. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events, may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease mortality and stroke (though not ruling out harms), but has little or no effect on all‐cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. The mechanism may be via lipid reduction, but increasing PUFA probably slightly increases weight.”

polyphenols,fv3eexd,comment,"I cited reviews of over 50 RCTs and you think a single cherry picked objectively flawed RCT is stronger evidence?

“ The Minnesota Coronary Survey34 compared high polyunsaturated with high saturated fat diets in patients hospitalized for mental illness. The participants were given the assigned diets only when they were patients in the hospital. Because hospitalization for mental illness became less common and less prolonged after the study started, as a national trend, the patients received the assigned diets intermittently, contrary to the intent of the researchers, and for a much shorter time than planned. The researchers originally enrolled 9570 participants in the trial and intended to study them for at least 3.6 years to be able to adequately test the effect of the diets. However, the trend toward outpatient treatment of mental illness resulted in ≈75% of the participants being discharged from inpatient care during the first year of the study. Only about half the remaining patients stayed in the study for at least 3 years. The average duration was only 384 days. The incidence of CHD events was similar in the 2 groups, 25.7 and 27.2 per 1000 person-years in the control and polyunsaturated fat groups, respectively. A recent reanalysis of this trial restricted to the participants who remained in the trial for at least 1 year also found no significant differences in CHD events or CHD deaths.39 We excluded this trial from the core group because of the short duration, large percentage of withdrawals from the study, and intermittent treatment, which is not relevant to clinical practice. Another concern is the use of lightly hydrogenated corn oil margarine in the polyunsaturated fat diet. This type of margarine contains trans linoleic acid, the type of trans fatty acid most strongly associated with CHD.40”

I’m arguing that it is likely we are going to find that PUFA in the form of vegetable oil is disrupting our metabolic processes and causing or exasperating metabolic and inflammatory diseases common in western countries.

How many times do you want me to say this? It’s my prediction. I get that you’re a nutrition student and absolutely in love with the preponderance of peer reviewed data currently available—but nutrition science is garbage right now. These studies often come to exact opposite conclusions. And just waving your hand and calling it cherry picked is one tool to ignore the mixed and contrary findings, sure.


“Increases in the ratio of n-6 : n-3 PUFA, characteristic of the Western diet, could potentiate inflammatory processes and consequently predispose to or exacerbate many inflammatory diseases. The change in ratio and increase in n-6 PUFA consumption change the production of important mediators and regulators of inflammation and immune responses towards a proinflammatory profile. Chronic conditions such as CVD, diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and IBD are all associated with increased production of PGE2, LTB4, TXA2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, whereby the production of these factors increases with increased dietary intake of n-6 PUFA and decreased dietary intake of n-3 PUFA. In conclusion, the unbalanced dietary consumption of n-6 : n-3 PUFA is detrimental to human health, and so the impact of dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA upon the alleviation of inflammatory diseases, more specifically, NAFLD needs to be more thoroughly investigated.”

Further, these studies weren’t removing PUFAs from their diet, for the most part. There is no suitable control in almost any of your studies.

You are oversimplifying the validity of those studies (who themselves admitted they were not conclusive or even high reliability) and making a fallacy of quantity.

I wouldn’t be foolish enough to rule out the possibility that PUFA consumption is linked with the development of inflammatory and metabolic disease, based on the known pathophysiological mechanism and the (admittedly small in number) studies that show metabolic and inflammatory damage secondary to vegetable oil PUFAs.

I wouldnt worry about the trace amounts of lead you might consume in your cocoa powder. Be more concerned about lead leeching into your body through other methods.

FWIW, take a look at the sub-section ""*Interim Reference Level*"",(in the section titled ""*FDA Monitoring and Testing of Lead in Food, including Dietary Supplements and Foodwares*"") from the following FDA website: [https://www.fda.gov/food/metals/lead-food-foodwares-and-dietary-supplements](https://www.fda.gov/food/metals/lead-food-foodwares-and-dietary-supplements). For convenience, I have copy and pastaed the section you might be interested in below (bolded the portion of main interest to you)

> Interim Reference Level
> 
> The FDA assesses whether the amount of lead in a food product is high enough to raise a person’s blood lead level to a point of concern. To do this, the agency establishes a maximum daily intake for lead, called the Interim Reference Level (IRL). In determining the IRL, the FDA takes into account the amount of a particular food a person would need to consume daily, as well as other factors, that would result in blood lead levels of 5µg per day, the level at which the CDC recommends clinical monitoring of lead exposure in children. The FDA has established the current IRL at 3 µg per day for children and **12.5 µg per day for adults. These levels allow for differences across populations and are set nearly ten-times less than the actual amount of intake from food required to reach the CDC’s blood reference level.** The adult level is particularly important for women of childbearing age, to protect against possible fetal exposure in women who are unaware that they are pregnant, and against infant exposure during nursing. The FDA will continue to research and evaluate the health effects and dietary exposure to lead and will update the IRL as appropriate.

Based on that quote, the actual dangerous level of lead is 125 ug (micrograms) per day. You would need to ingest ~100 tablespoons of cocoa powder per day to begin needing to worry.",1,2,False,1558304270.0,redditnaked,0.06183762183330346,0.5,0.03091881091665173,0.9711,0.030025257281160494,2.0300252572811606,bqlpgk

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

Yes, when heating oils, because destroys various compounds like enzymes and so you should not heat oils at all. And extra virgin oils undergo very low temperature processes specifically to maintain as many nutrients as possible. And it's counter-intuitive to talk about a smoke point on extra virgin oils.

As of the specific oils you used in the table I would avoid. Because it's much harder for the body to generate energy from unsaturated fat which would  be a good reason to consume oils in the first place.

Dr. Greger says:

“Whole food sources of fats, like everything else, tend to be preferable. One can think of extra virgin olive oil like fruit juice - it’s got nutrients, but the calories you get are relatively empty, compared to the whole fruit. Olives are, after all, fruits. You squeeze them, and you get olive juice. Less nutrition than the whole fruit. 

But then, it gets even worse. They throw away what’s called the olive wastewater, which contains all the water soluble nutrients in olives. So, the oil just has a small fraction of the nutrition of the whole fruit.”

I absolutely love my olive oil, and in all fairness, he has other videos which highlight some of its many benefits.  In fact, in this very video, it is shown than extra virgin olive oil lowers cardiovascular risk when compared to regular olive oil. It just so happens that the whole food fats from nuts edge it out a bit. 

This could be what the OP meant when referring to olive oil as a processed food. 

I agree that everything should be consumed in moderation, and that oils can be healthy, too.

>Compared with seed oils, VOO is preferable for frying, especially in home cooking (IOC). Under proper temperature conditions, without overheating, it undergoes no substantial changes and its performance is usually equal or superior to refined vegetable oils, due to its balanced composition regarding both major and minor components (Santos and others 2013). Olive oil contains 55% to 83% of monounsaturated oleic acid, which is 50 times less prone to oxidation than linoleic acid (Warner 2009), the polyunsaturated fatty acid that predominates in the majority of vegetable oils. Olive oil stands up well to high frying temperatures, as its high smoking point (210 °C) is well above the suggested temperature for frying food (180 °C; Bastida and Sanchez‐Muniz 2015). Smoking point of VOO has been reported to be lower (160 to 170 °C; Bastida and Sanchez‐Muniz 2015), although early studies (Detwiler and others 1940) had indicated a higher smoke point, that is 199 °C. According to Bastida and Sanchez‐Muniz (2015) factors such as the oil variety, and the presence of stabilizing compounds act as confounders to the clear determination of VOO smoking point.

This is mainly the result of its fatty acid composition and the presence of a variety of natural antioxidants which offer a balanced protection under thermal stress, thereby making olive oil a preferable choice for frying, especially under domestic conditions. This explains the improved stability of VOO when compared with other vegetable oils with equivalent oleic acid amounts, like high‐oleic sunflower oil.

>When processed under normal cooking conditions, with temperatures up to 180 to 190 °C, as is common in frying, olive oil performance is comparable or better than other vegetable oils. According to the most recent legislation, oil degradation is usually evaluated by the TPM or triacylglycerol oligomer fractions. In comparison with other vegetable oils, olive oil exhibits a lower formation rate of such compounds. However, as VOO phenolic compounds and tocopherols are gradually lost, when olive oil is selected as a frying oil for its potential health attributes, then it should be used in frying for only a limited period of time.",4,6,False,1547579628.0,dreiter,0.9928797328924358,0.2,0.19857594657848718,0.9633,0.19128820933905671,6.191288209339056,ee45sx4

Most antioxidants deal with end-stage oxidants, even products that are past the lipid peroxide stage, but do nothing to inhibit the earliest precursors like superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, or hydrogen peroxide. 

The reality is that effective neutralization of antioxidants is much more reliant on superoxide dismutase/reductase, glutathione, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, NADPH, regulation of iron, heavy metal exposure, etc. So you are much better off taking steps to improve the function of those systems rather than trying to get the antioxidants from exogenous sources.

polyphenols,du6zvk7,comment,"Ede is a psychiatrist that promotes ""low carb"" diets.  This is from a blog posted on the psychology today website-  not an actual, peer reviewed publication.

We know dietary antioxidants play a role in reduction of risk from of a variety of diseases (sources below).  We're pretty sure that supplements don't offer that same protection, in fact some antioxidant supplements have shown harmful effects (Vit. A, beta caratine, Vit. E, Vit. C. supplements all seem to increase mortality [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15464182) ).  That's an important distinction to make- Ede doesn't make the distinction between dietary and supplemental antioxidants.  


So, given the data shows benefits of diets rich in antioxidants (from foods) and that supplements of antioxidants don't show the same benefits and can even harm us- do we then conclude that ALL antioxidants are worth avoiding?  After all, antioxidants don't seem to be helpful outside of fruits and vegetables- that must mean antioxidants aren't good or useful...right?  That's fallacious reasoning- but it's being used by ""low carb"" and ""no carb"" groups to assuage valid worries about the benefits of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

Maybe we give Ede the benefit of the doubt and that she's simply pointing out the term ""antioxidant"" is being abused by companies promoting unhealthy foods- full of refined sugar, processed foods which contain antioxidants but which confer no health benefits.  To that message, I can agree.  The data supports these claims. 

""Trust in the capacity of your own internal antioxidants.""  This is misleading.  And suggestive that foods- like fruit and vegetables- that are high in antioxidants don't confer any benefit (or that we don't need them).  Why?  Other than the fact that she's a low carb guru, I can't explain this statement.  Her reasoning is that because antioxidant supplements do not confer benefits- foods naturally containing antioxidants do not confer benefits.  It's a logical fallacy- the fallacy of composition.  Even supposing anti-oxidants by themselves (outside of food) do not confer benefits that doesn't entail that foods naturally containing antioxidants also do not confer benefits.  In fact, it just so happens the foods that contain antioxidants do confer benefits- and the more antioxidants the better.  We would not see this effect if the best course of action was to avoid antioxidants and ""Trust in the capacity of your own internal antioxidants"" (sources below, more if needed).

What the heck do tannins have to do with anything?  The big overall point is that regardless of the impact plant based protein sources will be consumed with polyphenols.

> I don't agree with your assessment regarding plant/meat digestion. Fiber/complex carbohydrates do not increase transit time, as long complex chains also take a long time to break down and digest.

You might not agree but it's true.  When we eat a meal it gets digested as a meal.  This is why protein and fat slow down even complex carbohydrate processing.  Complex carbohydrates still have a GI value and if you eat things like pasta with cheese it is easily shown that there is a reduced GI value compared to the same pasta alone.  That's indicative that it's slowing down carbohydrate processing.  If everything is digested as a meal this means the carbohydrates aren't just going to shoot out first it's taking the rest of the meal along with it.  Since proteins and fats slow down carbohydrate processing that means that carbohydrates are speeding up fat and protein processing.

This is actually why fiber reduces serum cholesterol values.   It's actually inhibiting the uptake of dietary saturated fat and dietary cholesterol by speeding up digestion which consequently reduces efficiency of absorption.  It's also a reason why proteins and fats make us feel satiated longer.

I agree with most of what you've written here and further above. In my my post I was specifically disagreeing that raw or lightly cooked fibrous vegetables would speed digestion of meat up in any significant way, depending on the quantity consumed. Certainly if you had heaping quantities (1:1 meat:veggies) this would happen:

> So if you eat a lot of plant based carbohydrates with meat it's going to push the meat out before it's fully digested.

…but I think a typical side amount of vegetables would not have a significant impact on transit time (at least it doesn't for me personally, YMMV). But the rest of what you've written is spot-on. You can even use vegetables as ruffage to help buffer the effects of greasy/high-simple-carbohydrate foods.

Depends on how much organ meat and bone broth/skin/connective tissue you eat.  The biggest concern about eating that much muscle meat is high Methionine intake, which is converted to Homocysteine and without sufficient Folate and/or B12 and/or Glyceine (e.g. from bone broth), you won't convert it back to Methionine or Cysteine.

polyphenols,c8e5bgv,comment,"Your thoughts are headed in the right direction, and I applaud you for thinking critically about a topic often taught to be as fundamentally true as the first law of thermodynamics. 

Where I would suggest you pursue this line of thinking further is mechanism behind your statement ""certain foods have a propensity to leave their calories distributed one way or another.""

It is this topic that the traditional calorie balance theory fails to address and that its proponents often refuse to consider as a possibility. 

The flaw in traditional calorie balance theory is that it is based on the supposition that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are nothing more than the potential energy stored in their chemical bonds. If this were the case, then the ""a calorie is a calorie is a calorie"" line of reasoning would make sense and the idea that the only determining factors in body composition changes are caloric intake and exercise would hold true. 

The problem, of course, is that considering food molecules as having no affect on then human metabolism other than the provision of energy is terribly naive. The biochemist, Dr. Richard Hansen (of ""[mighty mouse](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071101162739.htm)"" fame) once explained this to me so simply that I was shocked I hadn't figured it out on my own: ""All food molecules are hormones.""

Doesn't it seem painfully obvious now? It is widely accepted that glucose absorbed from foods acts to stimulate insulin production (this is an *hormonal* action, not unlike the action of thyroid stimulating hormone to promote thyroxine production), but many lesser known, but no less influential, hormonal actions of food molecules exist,  including the binding of fatty acids to [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPAR) to become hormones influencing gene expression to regulate several processes *including metabolism*. 

I think it's funny that people have no qualms accepting that corticosteroids like prednisone can [cause people who consume them to eat more and gain weight](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/steroids/HQ01431) but then manage to maintain some sort of cognitive dissonance in order to so firmly believe that the same could never be true of macronutrients.


Edit: I want to note that, despite having such insight into the influence of macronutrients, I do not think that Dr. Hansen openly rejects calorie balance theory, and I do not want to misrepresent him as such

polyphenols,c8dxv6x,comment,"Your wonderful examples are flawed. It's word games and poor logic.

A) Banana example ...

""Taking in an excess of sugar will likely make you fat"" ... that applies to an actual excess of any macro-nutrient. You, yourself state that the banana is digested into 250 calories of glucose. Why is that so different to eating 250 calories of sugar in the soda? Merely rate of uptake and insulin response. 250 calories of excess gets stored as fat either way. You may be more satiated by the banana than the soda however, but that was not your argument.

B) Puberty kid ...

The kid going through puberty is not eating at an excess, you have just done your math wrong. I will do the math for you. If the kid is eating 2,500 calories per day and growing muscle mass, and not gaining fat mass ... then he is not eating at an excess. The fact that 1,500 calories goes to upkeep of his current body, 500 calories to exercise energy, and another 500 calories to lean body mass synthesis adds up fine. 

By definition, eating at excess results in caloric storage ... either glycogen stores (if available) or fat stores if the glycogen stores are full. The body does not ""Store"" excess calories as muscle or protein because this is a HIGHLY inefficient process (about 3,500 calories to create a pound of muscle and about 800 calories released from consuming a pound of muscle). For comparison, storing and retrieving calories in the form of fat has about a 3% loss rate, which is why it is the evolutionarily developed form of mid-term to long-term calorie storage in humans. Our glycogen stores are our readily available, short-term storage - which has almost zero caloric losses.

If humans used muscle tissue to store calories instead of fat, we would have died out with the first famine. Fat serves a valuable purpose. I'll give you a hint :

* Guy A has 20 extra pounds of fat (cost 70,000 calories to build, 67,900 available to consume)
* Guy B has 20 extra pounds of muscle (cost 70,000 calories to build, 16,000 calories available to consume)
* Who lives longer during the famine????

different diets that intentionally limit carbohydrate intake (e.g. the 4 hour body, paleo etc. [ignoring keto diets here]) all point to the impact on insulin on weight gain. so if you eat carbs, blood sugar increases, insulin released causes cells to uptake sugars from the blood. if work producing cells (e.g. vital organs and muscles) require energy they will uptake the glucose, any remaining glucose is taken up by fat cells and converted to fat. at the same time fat from the blood is also stored in fat cells. foods high in processed carbs cause insulin to increase, foods such as these are often accompanied by lots of fats (think chips, burgers, etc.) hence these foods are highly obesogenic.

You can use excess calories for muscle growth or skeletal growth.  Skeletal growth only happens in children and adolescents so lets ignore it.  Muscle growth only takes place at a slow rate, about 1/4 to 1/2 lb/week and only in the presence of appropriate stimulus and all applicable nutrients.

I think we are recommended far too many carbs, but that's food politics and a totally different argument.

Your argument is that an excess of 250 kcal of eggs is different than 250 kcal of banana or sugar.  This is wrong.  ALL macronutrients in excess are converted to and stored as fat.  Period. What I think you intended to argue is that protein has secondary functions that carbs do not.  The argument here is that carbohydrates are the only non-essential macro for supporting human life.  Meaning they don't do anything besides provide energy. (Yes the brain is entirely fueled by glucose, but glucogenic amino acids can be converted into glucose if necessary). 

The argument of body composition is this.  Your body requires x amount of protein per day.  If you exercise regularly your body will require x + y protein per day (y being the amount of damaged tissue and new proteins required).  If you are not in need of excess protein (exercise or injury) your body will not use it.  Just because you consume a caloric excess of protein does not mean your body will use it to build muscle.  If growth hormone has not been secreted from exercise, RNA and enzymes will not assume protein production. Moreover, if you are exercising or going through puberty your body requires more protein.

But wouldn't the majority of that effect have to do with the fact that it's a hell of a lot more difficult to consume 1000 calories worth of vegetables compared to 1000 calories worth of foods high in refined sugar?

While one of the cornerstones to weight loss is often ""eat less"", the advice that usually goes with that is to eat foods that are more satiating e.g. high in fibre, high in protein, etc.  In the end the counselling strategy would be similar, because if someone is eating high amounts of refined sugar, making those types of healthy choices is likely to result in a decrease in calories.

I'd encourage you to give some critical thought to this idea that fat gain is more voluntary than growth. And don't take this as a personal attack, what you are saying is certainly in line with general opinion and government recommendations, but I argue that the claim is unfounded. 

If I ask why the muscle gain and growth during puberty is involuntary, I'll quickly get the accurate answer that hormones are driving that growth. If I ask how teenagers are able to eat the right amounts at the right times to fuel that growth, I'll get the same reply: hormones regulate their appetites and drive them to eat voraciously during spurts of rapid growth. 

So, if fat gain is to be of a fundamentally different origin in order to be voluntary, mustn't it also have different causes? The boilerplate answer is, ""Yes, fat gain is caused by caloric excess,"" but have you ever been presented with a mechanism to support that claim? 

I've never come across any known regulation of biochemical processes that is based upon a whole-body sense of caloric excess or deficit (or even a mechanism to sense caloric balance). Instead, the origins of lipogenesis and adipocyte uptake of triglycerides are both known to be hormonally regulated (primarily via insulin).

So how is it that we can accept a hormonally driven process leading to increased intake and muscle gain as obligatory, but a hormonally driven process leading to increased intake and fat gain as voluntary (especially considering that either process can be prevented by forcefully restricting intake)?

 Protiens and fats as are found in eggs are digested slower, and provide a longer 'calorie burn' and are rich in nutrients. This stabilizes blood sugar and stops the cycle of binging and crashing.

I would agree that ""fat gain is caused by caloric excess"" is a somewhat simplistic, functional statement, but true nevertheless. Maybe not very helpful either.

What causes people to eat a caloric excess? That is a very sticky question that several industries are based around exploiting! I don't know, and I suspect there are several different answers or combinations of factors that may be different from person to person. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestive_behaviors has a decent primer discussion of the physiological and other factors that regulate homeostasis.

the other issue many people have (and you seem to have had in the past) is the idea of a 'diet' you cant eat less for a little while, lose weight then expect to be able to go back to stuffing your face full of fatty foods and maintain the weight loss. that simply isnt how it works. calories in/calories out is a paradigm that must be maintained indefinitely eating at or less than your TDEE will promote long term weight loss and then weight maintenance.

polyphenols,c13lqpx,comment,Well my list is related to foods I might normally eat so there may be other ones that are also bad. There are the foods I mentioned in the post. I actually started with the foods on this site about migraines http://www.widomaker.com/~jnavia/tannins/index.html Because it had a good list of high tannin foods and the first foods I found that were the worst were tea and read wine - both foods really high in tannins. It's almost worth going on some kind of very restrictive elimination diet for a couple of weeks to see if there's any improvement and then adding foods back in. I'm at the point where I can tell if I've inadvertently eaten something that makes it worse (like prunes recently).,2,1,False,1288197175.0,growingconcern,0.8275911227301734,0.3333333333333333,0.27586370757672446,-0.4754,-0.1311456065819748,0.8688543934180252,c13hu9z
